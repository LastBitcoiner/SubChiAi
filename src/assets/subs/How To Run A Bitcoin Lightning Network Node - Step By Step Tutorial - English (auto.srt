1
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:07,040
wasabi wallet

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:09,519
unfairly private

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:12,080
the lightning network is a second layer

4
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:15,120
built on top of bitcoin that allows for

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,960
cheaper and faster transactions it

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,119
allows the network as a whole to scale

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,520
to millions of transactions per

8
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:23,439
second now there are many different ways

9
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,080
to interact with the lightning network

10
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,400
including

11
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,279
custodial and non-custodial apps that

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,760
you can simply

13
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:31,359
install on your mobile device or you can

14
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,640
go the full mile

15
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,520
and run a full lightning node which is

16
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,920
exactly

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,000
what we're going to be covering today i

18
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:45,660
am ben with the btc sessions

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:56,680
and this is your daily session

20
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:56,680
[Music]

21
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,800
before we dive in of course a quick

22
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,039
shout out to sponsors of the show

23
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,799
len io this is where you can use your

24
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,080
bitcoin for a variety of different

25
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,920
services

26
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,840
of course they have their bitcoin backed

27
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,600
loans which is primarily what i have

28
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,920
used them for and

29
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,119
this really helps if you're in a pinch

30
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,560
and you need to get your hands on

31
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,000
dollars but you don't want to sell your

32
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,479
bitcoin because of course

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,360
that is a taxable event and two you

34
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:23,200
might be worried

35
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,360
about having a buy back in at a higher

36
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,119
price so here you're able to deposit

37
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,479
bitcoin get dollars to your bank account

38
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,479
within 24 hours

39
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:32,240
and when you pay those dollars back you

40
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,119
get back the exact same amount of

41
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,640
bitcoin

42
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,720
of course they also have their bitcoin

43
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,560
and usdc savings accounts with interest

44
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,960
rates of up to 12 and a half percent

45
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,360
annually paid monthly and they've got

46
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,680
their b2x offering which uses the

47
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,200
same loan mechanism to instantly buy you

48
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,520
more bitcoin if you're feeling

49
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,040
mega bullish there's a link to check

50
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,320
them out in the show notes down below

51
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,920
and if you click that link and off to

52
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,920

give you 25 bucks for free into your

54
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,240
savings

55
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,600
up next we have bit refill now i do live

56
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,240
on bitcoin and one of the

57
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,920
things that really helps me do this is

58
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,160
bit refill in that they have

59
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,800
just every damn gift card you can

60
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,640
imagine in just about every country

61
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,319
you could imagine so you can head over

62
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,280
here and you can easily

63
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,319
get anything you need paid for with

64
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,879
bitcoin either

65
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,879
on the main chain or conveniently

66
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:25,680
conveniently as we're covering it today

67
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,120
on the lightning network of course you

68
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,480
also earn sats back

69
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,239
as you shop which is wonderful and

70
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,599
they've got a pretty killer referral

71
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,640
program as well

72
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:35,760
links for that will be down below and

73
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,160
finally

74
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,519
if you're backing up any bitcoin wallet

75
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,560
including

76
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:46,560
the node that you are using today

77
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,720
for your lightning wallet um

78
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,080
it's a good idea to do so securely and

79
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,680
sometimes a piece of paper

80
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:56,000
is not always the best option so

81
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,879
something on solid steel like the bill

82
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,640
fotl can

83
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,000
save you from things like fire damage

84
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,760
water damage or

85
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,120
just somebody accidentally throwing out

86
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,280
that slip of paper

87
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,040
so please give yourself that peace of

88
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,000
mind i've heard some horror stories as

89
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,760
of late and

90
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,599
this solid piece of steel with little

91
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,920
tiles where you slide in to

92
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,640
back up your seed phrase is exactly how

93
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,879
i back up

94
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,040
all major important seed phrases for

95
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,720
wallets that i have so be sure to check

96
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,920
them out and with that let's dive

97
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,920
into the tutorial

98
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,959
now if you are just starting with

99
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,200
bitcoin

100
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,720
running a lightning node is probably not

101
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,360
going to be your first step

102
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,599
there are some prerequisites that you

103
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,080
should likely have before diving in

104
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,959
here and so i'm going to bring up some

105
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,879
of those so

106
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,480
if you are at that point then wonderful

107
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,319
we can go ahead but if you're not

108
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,000
probably good to go back and do some

109
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,440
basic learning first so let's take a

110
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,480
look at some things that might be

111
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,680
beneficial to you

112
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,319
first um first up of course bitcoin

113
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,640
basics

114
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,879
things like where to get bitcoin how to

115
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,720
use a regular bitcoin wallet

116
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:03,280
even maybe a little bit of security

117
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:06,080
about how to use a hardware device

118
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:09,120
stuff like that is very beneficial um

119
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,760
also a general knowledge of bitcoin fees

120
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,760
how to set

121
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,000
transaction fees things like that all of

122
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,239
those will really help you along the way

123
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,840
using a lightning node and i do have a

124
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:19,759
playlist called getting started

125
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,359
you can find it and you can kind of pick

126
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,400
through some of those

127
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:27,759
videos to help you along your way now

128
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:30,880
up next you also do need

129
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:32,320
to have a bitcoin node a full bitcoin

130
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,400
node not just a lightning node

131
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,240
a full bitcoin node running a copy of

132
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,280
the bitcoin blockchain

133
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:42,160
now today i'm going to be using umbral

134
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,759
uh but you can also use my node and

135
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,600
there are some other setups that you can

136
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,440
use as well but i have done tutorials

137
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,360
for both of those both umbral

138
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,600
and my node they're a little bit

139
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,560
different so if you're running my node

140
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,440
it's going to look a little bit

141
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,440
different for you

142
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,759
to utilize the programs we're using

143
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,960
today but in general if you don't have a

144
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,840
node go back

145
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,720
use this umbral video to get yourself

146
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,360
set up

147
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,440
really really simple to get it rolling

148
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,960
so get yourself a bitcoin note if you

149
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,000
don't have one already

150
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,440
and then finally a little bit of basic

151
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,759
knowledge about lightning

152
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,520
would be incredibly beneficial and what

153
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,199
i was what i'm talking about here is

154
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,759
maybe you should play around a little

155
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,960
bit

156
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:25,919
with a non-lightning node

157
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,400
intensive you know all the nitty gritty

158
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,120
first

159
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,240
just to familiarize yourself with how to

160
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,720
receive and send

161
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,919
transactions and that will also help you

162
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,000
here so that it

163
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,960
isn't as foreign when you get into the

164
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,720
nitty-gritty

165
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,479
of running everything i do have

166
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,240
tutorials on that i would recommend

167
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,360
checking out things like breeze or

168
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,080
phoenix

169
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,919
if you want to really easy just jump in

170
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,320
try a few transactions and then jump in

171
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,000
here

172
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,360
then something like the custodial

173
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,160
version of blue wallet

174
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,880
or wallet of satoshi will be just fine

175
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,400
for you

176
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:00,240
but with that said let's chat a little

177
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,720
bit about a lightning node and what it

178
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,720
entails

179
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,080
so let's discuss lightning channels

180
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,919
because

181
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,240
this is going to be the bulk of our

182
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:14,400
learning with this tutorial

183
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,880
what is a lightning channel well

184
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,199
effectively it is the act of a locking

185
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,520
up

186
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:25,440
bitcoin between two peers in a multi-sig

187
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:27,520
so that you can effectively allocate

188
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,600
which bitcoin belongs to who and do a

189
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,800
bunch of tiny transactions

190
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,000
off-chain before settling to the main

191
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,880
bitcoin blockchain

192
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,720
so let's do a hypothetical let's say you

193
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,759
were a bartender who under

194
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:44,880
who owned a bar i'm a patron and

195
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,400
i could settle every single time you

196
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,360
bring me a drink this would be like

197
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,440
doing a bitcoin

198
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,400
transaction every time a beer comes over

199
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,160
to the table

200
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,400
however that's not efficient the fees

201
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,080
would be not great and if everybody did

202
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,800
that the blockchain would be so bogged

203
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,800
down it would be

204
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,639
difficult to get a transaction through

205
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,319
we'd be waiting for final settlement so

206
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,479
and so forth

207
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,599
now with lightning the way this would

208
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,080
happen is

209
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:09,440
i would lock up a hundred dollars in a

210
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,880
tab with you

211
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,560
and every time you brought me over a

212
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:15,599
drink i would allocate

213
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,919
five dollars of my hundred dollar pool

214
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,880
over to you so this is effectively a

215
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:21,199
contract

216
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,560
of that locked up bitcoin so let's say

217
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,080
by the end of the night you brought me

218
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,720
over five beers i

219
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,800
gave you five dollars each time and so

220
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,440
now the contract between us with that

221
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,080
locked up bitcoin says you get 25 bucks

222
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,280
and i keep

223
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:37,199
75 of that we're able to then close that

224
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,880
channel and settle that to the main

225
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,680
bitcoin blockchain

226
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:44,000
only having done two actual on-chain

227
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,720
transactions one creating the multi-sig

228
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,680
and one closing it out and oftentimes

229
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,240
these channels

230
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,160
don't ever really need to be closed uh

231
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,840
or very seldom need to be closed

232
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,400
so that that effectively could be left

233
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,960
open

234
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,840
if i decided to come back another time

235
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,080
okay

236
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,840
so that's the basics behind it let's

237
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,080
take a look at a visualization that

238
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,879
shows something like that

239
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,440
so here's an example of a channel open

240
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,919
between

241
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,520
alice and bob alice has said hey i'm

242
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:14,800
going to be transacting with bob a fair

243
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,560
amount what i'm going to do is i'm going

244
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,879
to lock up this bitcoin here

245
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,759
and if i want to pay him i can bump it

246
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,000
over to his

247
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,759
side of the channel and if either of us

248
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,520
any either have a dispute or just want

249
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,160
to go our separate ways we can close the

250
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,000
channel

251
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:32,640
and settle so if alice wants to pay bob

252
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,640
say two bitcoin it would look like this

253
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,519
she just bumps those bitcoin over to his

254
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,440
side of the channel

255
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,120
again at any point either of them can

256
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,159
leave and keep their own

257
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,720
bitcoin as the updated version

258
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,920
of that contract now where it gets

259
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,800
interesting

260
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,839
is if bob is also connected to another

261
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,080
peer

262
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,440
let's say bob is also connected to carol

263
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,839
he has created his own

264
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,680
lightning channel with her at this point

265
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,399
alice now has the option to also pay

266
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,040
carol

267
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,160
through bob and so let's say alice

268
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,320
wanted to send

269
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,600
two bitcoin to carol she could do that

270
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,360
by sending two to bob

271
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,519
and then bob sends two to carol and that

272
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,760
would look like this

273
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,360
two moved over to bob and bob bounce

274
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,120
that down the line to carol and this is

275
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,880
enforced through contracts so

276
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,800
it's not like bob can just steal the

277
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,320
money in the middle

278
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,160
a little animation of how this would

279
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,320
look you can see alice

280
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,560
bumps money to bob bob bumps money to

281
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,440
carol just like that

282
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:31,040
now normally you wouldn't just have a

283
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,800
single channel open with

284
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,080
an individual you would have multiple

285
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,320
channels open to

286
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,000
multiple well-connected other

287
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,760
individuals or other notes

288
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,440
and let's take a look at this really

289
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,080
cool graphic here

290
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,080
and i'll just unclick but this is the

291
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,320
lightning network as it stands right now

292
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,000
and these are all participants who have

293
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,800
a lightning nodes

294
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,320
if i zoom in we can click on an

295
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,279
individual who has

296
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,640
a lightning network node and we can see

297
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,880
all of their connections

298
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,160
you can see quite a few of them here

299
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,640
they're pretty

300
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,079
they've got a fair number of channels

301
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,959
and let's just take a look

302
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:09,920
at where they're connected now of course

303
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,640
this individual

304
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,680
can do transactions with all of the

305
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,680
nodes that they're

306
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,839
currently connected with but they can

307
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,399
also do transactions with all of the

308
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:20,000
nodes

309
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,600
that any of their connections are

310
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,440
connected with so let's take a look

311
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,519
there's a channel here leading to this

312
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,839
larger node

313
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,040
and look at all the peers that this

314
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,880
individual has

315
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,079
and not only that but this individual is

316
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:35,040
connected over to

317
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,440
this large node over here and look at

318
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,519
that

319
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:41,279
look at the amount of possible pathways

320
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,959
of connecting with peers here so you can

321
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:46,399
see very quickly there's like this

322
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:49,120
six degrees of kevin bacon effect where

323
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,480
if you've got a few good connections you

324
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:54,880
effectively can reach

325
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:56,560
everyone very easily with a transaction

326
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,079
now there is some other stuff to

327
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,640
consider here um

328
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:02,800
you have to consider uh a little bit

329
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,800
about the size of your channels

330
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,640
because in this first instance with

331
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,480
alice she has a limited amount of

332
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:12,000
bitcoin that she can send

333
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:14,079
and when bob was connected to carol here

334
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,440
he has a limited amount of bitcoin if he

335
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:17,839
only had

336
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,560
one bitcoin locked up between him and

337
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,880
carol

338
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,480
and she wanted to send two like alice

339
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,160
wanted to send to

340
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,000
that transaction wouldn't work because

341
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,760
there'd be a bottleneck so

342
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,200
you got to consider the size of your

343
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,040
channels and how you're going to be

344
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:34,079
transacting as well

345
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,680
we will get into that but this hopefully

346
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:38,160
was a decent little primer

347
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,880
to get your head around how lightning

348
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,839
channels

349
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:44,880
and liquidity works let's get into

350
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:44,880
actually doing this thing

351
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,399
so first things first let's get kind of

352
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,519
an overview of what we're going to be

353
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,920
looking at here

354
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,760
if you have not set up an umbral node or

355
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:58,880
if you're using my node then

356
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:01,680
one you've got to get a node going so be

357
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:03,279
sure to head back and do that

358
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,399
but if you're using my node the

359
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,200
interface will look a little bit

360
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,959
different but

361
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,639
this concepts are still generally the

362
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,160
same within your node you're going to

363
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,920
have two separate wallets you're gonna

364
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,000
have a bitcoin wallet

365
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,200
and a lightning wallet all right these

366
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,360
are also accessible

367
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,800
via the side here now your bitcoin

368
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,760
wallet is going to need to have

369
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,639
funds in it in order to load up the

370
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,279
lightning wallet

371
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:27,519
so very easy to do that within your

372
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:30,320
bitcoin wallet you just hit deposit

373
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,959
you're greeted with your address via qr

374
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,160
code and

375
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:35,839
uh down below and again part of the

376
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,480
prerequisite is knowing how to use

377
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,440
bitcoin

378
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,320
regular transactions as is so be sure to

379
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,079
load that up and

380
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,600
send yourself some bitcoins so that you

381
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:47,519
have it sitting on your

382
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:49,360
node now the lightning wallet i did show

383
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:53,600
in my umbrella tutorial

384
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:55,279
okay i did show that previously however

385
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,000
this is not how we're going to be

386
00:12:55,279 --> 00:13:00,560
interacting with lightning today

387
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,839
it is important to know that any apps

388
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,399
within umbral

389
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:06,240
that reference lightning will be all

390
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:08,720
just ways of interacting

391
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,639
with this particular lightning node it's

392
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,519
all the same it's just different ways of

393
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,680
looking at it

394
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,760
okay so what we're going to be using

395
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:18,800
today is something within the app store

396
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:21,040
so since doing my original umbral

397
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,560
node video they have added an app store

398
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,519
where you can download a whole bunch of

399
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,639
different stuff

400
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:28,240
you can see over here there's four

401
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,519
different options and eventually there

402
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,000
may be more

403
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,839
for lightning node management they have

404
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,560
ride the lightning lightning terminal

405
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:37,839
thunderhub

406
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:40,399
and ln bits today i'm going to be using

407
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:42,480
thunderhub primarily and we will pop

408
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:44,880
into lightning terminal once

409
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,040
just to do something but i will go in

410
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:50,720
depth with lightning terminal in another

411
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,839
video but for now i have my apps again i

412
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:55,360
can go to my

413
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:56,959
apps tab here and i can see thunderhub

414
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,199
and i can just click on it and open it

415
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,360
up

416
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:01,440
now i do already have it open so let's

417
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,199
just take a look at that

418
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,800
and i'll get back to the home page here

419
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,279
this is what you will see when you first

420
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,519
land

421
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:09,680
and of course i already have funds in

422
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,120
lightning and on my umbrella notes so

423
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,800
it'll look a little bit different and i

424
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,839
already have channels going

425
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:17,839
so yours will be a little bit more bare

426
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:19,680
initially but let's look at what's in

427
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,519
front of us on your home page you're

428
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,040
going to get a lot of basic stuff

429
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,480
um how much you've got sitting in

430
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,680
lightning how much you've got sitting in

431
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,519
bitcoin

432
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,120
you'll have your public key just

433
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,560
information based on your node if

434
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:34,399
somebody wants to connect

435
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:36,000
with you uh all of your quick actions

436
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,600
if you want to open a channel will be

437
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,040
down here if you want to take a look at

438
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,279
an invoice

439
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:44,720
all kinds of different stuff here

440
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:47,279
invoices and payments reports

441
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,120
any balances that you have incoming and

442
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:51,040
outgoing how much you're able to spend

443
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,440
and receive

444
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,320
lots of different information about

445
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,000
routes and

446
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,440
transactions going through and i'm kind

447
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
of glossing this over because we'll get

448
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,160
to some of

449
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,160
it later you can click on your peers see

450
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,959
anybody that you currently have channels

451
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,120
open with

452
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:06,720
and your relationships with them again

453
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:10,000
you can get more details

454
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,920
on channels that you're using and in

455
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
incoming and outgoing transactions and

456
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:15,760
fees and all of that

457
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,440
you can rebalance your channels we'll

458
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:20,240
get into that concept later

459
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,639
um lots of great details throughout here

460
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,639
again

461
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,000
previous transactions you can take a

462
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:25,360
look at

463
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,519
any transactions that have been

464
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,360
forwarded through your node and any

465
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,759
fees that you've collected from doing

466
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,480
that um any of your on-chain

467
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:36,639
transactions there's tools here in

468
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:39,600
regarding backups

469
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:41,120
swapping into and out of lightning

470
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,480
that's an option here

471
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:46,240
and stats about your node and

472
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,000
uh just in general if you've got a

473
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:51,680
really well connected node

474
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:55,040
stats in terms of if you're on a

475
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:56,959
kind of high ranking list in terms of

476
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,720
your node there's also settings down

477
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,440
below for whether you want to see in

478
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,639
sats

479
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:04,959
in bitcoin or in fiat dollars

480
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,920
and you can change between light mode

481
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:08,880
night mode

482
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:10,720
and dark mode so all of that is there

483
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,680
you also have settings up top in the

484
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,079
right hand

485
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,360
corner there's a toggle and you can set

486
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,759
things

487
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,440
over there as well okay so that's kind

488
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,680
of the basics of

489
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,880
what's in front of you for thunderhub

490
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,920
and

491
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,959
more or less we will be diving into the

492
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,800
details of that

493
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:30,560
in general but pretty much your your

494
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,440
side menu here is going to get you where

495
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,399
you need to go

496
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,279
and you've got a summary of all funds uh

497
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,480
up in the top

498
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:41,120
left now

499
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,600
we also want to familiarize ourselves

500
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,680
with

501
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:49,199
a website called one ml

502
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:52,079
and one ml is a website that

503
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:53,040
you can look up information in regards

504
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:55,199
to

505
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,480
other lightning nodes or your own

506
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:59,839
lightning nodes so

507
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:02,320
let's just look up mine as an example

508
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,519
so mine does have an alias it is named

509
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,720
btc sessions

510
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:07,679
but here it is right here and if i click

511
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,799
on my node

512
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:13,439
i can see my public key and this

513
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:15,039
is the information that anybody would

514
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:18,559
need just to connect and

515
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:21,839
create a channel with me um it gives you

516
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:22,959
some stats on your node and some of

517
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:26,319
these node rank

518
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:30,000
stats here um basically the idea is the

519
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:32,960
lower the number the better okay so

520
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,760
um it's ranking from one and then

521
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,360
downwards

522
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:38,080
so if you your node is often offline or

523
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,960
if it's

524
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,400
relatively new then your availability

525
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,760
will be relatively

526
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,320
low but as you've been on long online

527
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,600
longer

528
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:52,799
then this will reduce the number here

529
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:55,440
and so i can also see the capacity

530
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,000
in terms of other lightning nodes doing

531
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,400
pretty well

532
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,760
i'm a special case because i'm lucky

533
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,120
enough to have a number of people that

534
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,600
wanted to connect with me

535
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,880
but besides the point this kind of just

536
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,240
gives you an idea now

537
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,640
when you're looking to connect with

538
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,880
other people you're kind of looking for

539
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:14,480
lower values here you're looking for

540
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:17,919
an availability you know probably below

541
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:20,400
500 is is a good aim uh same with

542
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:22,320
depending on what you're looking to do

543
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,160
somewhat higher capacity

544
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,600
would be better but we'll get into the

545
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,760
details of that later

546
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,200
and uh the number of channels is also

547
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,200
another one to look

548
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:34,000
look at so you can see channel count

549
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:36,640
ranking it says that i've got 33

550
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,280
channels there and i'm decently up the

551
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,600
list for

552
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:42,880
the amount of connections so that's kind

553
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:44,960
of a roundabout way of using 1ml

554
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,720
you can also just go on there and browse

555
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,120
and look through it'll show you

556
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:51,200
some of the top capacity increases in

557
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,520
the top number of channels

558
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,320
you don't always necessarily want to

559
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,480
connect to

560
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,160
large channels because if you have other

561
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,080
people connecting through you

562
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,080
you'll find those channels tend to drain

563
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,559
because people are routing payments that

564
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,320
way

565
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:07,280
and you need to rebalance once in a

566
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:10,640
while again details we'll get into later

567
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:13,120
but you can just kind of go for a stroll

568
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,640
and one way that i like to do this is i

569
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,600
hit the directory

570
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,919
and you just pick a random type of node

571
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,280
like

572
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:22,720
productivity people can designate

573
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,640
their their type of node that they're

574
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,480
running um and then you can just kind of

575
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:30,240
look through and and see

576
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:31,919
okay so this person uh has about half a

577
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,720
bitcoin of capacity

578
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,760
going in and out and if i click on them

579
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:39,120
i can see

580
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:41,520
again availability 584 yeah

581
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,480
not fantastic but on its way down so

582
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,799
that's not bad

583
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,400
um and then i can also see people just

584
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:47,919
above or just below

585
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,679
this individual and then i can start

586
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:50,320
clicking through okay what about this

587
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,120
person

588
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:54,000
i've got a bit more capacity although

589
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,840
they're not as

590
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,160
available they had a little bit more

591
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:01,679
downtime okay let's go a couple more

592
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:04,400
up now this person has a lot of downtime

593
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:06,559
let's keep going

594
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,600
and you can just kind of start clicking

595
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:10,799
through

596
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:13,600
and seeing what might

597
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:15,280
be uh this person's doing all right so

598
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:18,720
availability 154

599
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:21,039
capacity 532

600
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,919
in and around that 500 range not bad

601
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:24,240
okay

602
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,760
not bad so this is an individual that

603
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,480
maybe you might want to open up a

604
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:30,559
channel with

605
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,559
you can also go to stats

606
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,480
and you can see their average channel

607
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:37,679
capacity this person has an

608
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,400
average channel capacity is of 0.045

609
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:41,520
bitcoin

610
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:44,799
around 2500 um

611
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:47,840
or i guess that would be 4.5 million

612
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:49,039
sats and the reason that's important to

613
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:52,559
look at

614
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:53,679
is because it depends on what size of

615
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:55,520
transactions

616
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:57,440
you are going to be sending if

617
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,919
somebody's average channel capacity is

618
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,280
only

619
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:03,440
50 bucks and you want to send 100 or 200

620
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,720
payments that's going to be a bottleneck

621
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,440
for you and if you

622
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,840
ever want to send a large transaction so

623
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,400
um

624
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:12,799
if i ever think i might send more than

625
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,799
2500 bucks through the lightning network

626
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:16,000
then maybe this isn't a good pier for me

627
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:18,640
to connect to because i

628
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,280
want an average channel capacity above

629
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,919
that

630
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,799
so all things to consider when you're

631
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:26,240
connecting to

632
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:28,400
another peer and you should be

633
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,960
somewhat picky with who you connect to

634
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:33,200
or who you tie up your own bitcoin with

635
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,640
because if it doesn't serve you if

636
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,960
you're not able to

637
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,480
route payments through them then you've

638
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:41,120
now locked up bitcoin

639
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,640
that kind of becomes useless to you and

640
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,360
you might need to close the channel

641
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,480
later

642
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:48,400
and that incurs on-chain fees so you got

643
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,200
to do this balancing act so just keep

644
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,799
that in mind

645
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,480
as you're opening channels but we're

646
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:53,120
going to dive into actually opening some

647
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,919
channels

648
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,919
right now

649
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,760
so we're gonna start diving in here and

650
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:05,520
what we're gonna do first

651
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:07,280
is we're going to set up a basic channel

652
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:09,679
so you saw me kind of peeking through

653
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:12,159
that website one ml before

654
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:13,679
looking at various nodes where i might

655
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:16,080
want to connect a channel

656
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:16,799
however you can also do this if you know

657
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,280
somebody

658
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:20,960
that has a lightning node and you would

659
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,640
like to create a channel

660
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,400
with them and so that's what i'm going

661
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,360
to be doing right now now i know

662
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,480
somebody that

663
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,760
uh has said that they wouldn't mind me

664
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:33,200
setting up a channel with them

665
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:35,360
or you know vice versa and so i'm gonna

666
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,320
do so now what they have sent me is

667
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:39,679
their public

668
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:42,720
key and on your node in thunderhub

669
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:44,400
it looks like this it's right here boom

670
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,320
that's the information that somebody

671
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:49,120
needs to know in order

672
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,760
to set up a channel with you in fact uh

673
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,840
what you

674
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,360
you'll end up doing is there's a little

675
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:56,240
little button that says onion

676
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,200
and you hit that and it copies the onion

677
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,280
address

678
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,720
that somebody needs in order to open a

679
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,720
channel with you

680
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,000
now i was able to search up this person

681
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,240
on one ml as well

682
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,200
to see their channel capacity all that

683
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,400
kind of stuff

684
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:13,520
and you'll notice that their public key

685
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:15,280
is above and down below is the full

686
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,640
onion address and this is what we need

687
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,960
to open a channel with them

688
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,480
so really simply what i'm going to do is

689
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,039
i copy this information

690
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,000
and maybe somebody sends it via message

691
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,360
to you whatever

692
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,360
as long as you have that information

693
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,480
you're good and then i just go to

694
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,000
thunderhub

695
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,880
and just part way down the page you're

696
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:36,559
going to see a button that says open

697
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:38,240
this is going to open up a set of

698
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:40,320
possible places where you could open

699
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,559
channels with where they suggest

700
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,440
but you want a manual open so you're

701
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:45,520
going to hit

702
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,559
the open button to give you all those

703
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,559
options

704
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:50,240
now first it asks you is this a new

705
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,960
person a new peer that you're connecting

706
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,320
with yes

707
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,799
it is so i'm going to hit yes now is

708
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,279
this

709
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:58,720
uh it asks for the new node information

710
00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:00,960
and that's where we're going to paste in

711
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:04,159
the information we just copied

712
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:06,000
okay next it says what channel

713
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:07,360
size do you want how much do you want to

714
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,159
be able to spend between you and this

715
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:11,120
person

716
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:12,240
i'm going to set it for 1 million

717
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,720
satoshi's

718
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,679
now the reason i'm doing that is

719
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,559
anything below

720
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:19,840
a million satoshi's can be a little bit

721
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:23,360
more difficult to

722
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:25,840
maintain and what i mean is the on-chain

723
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,440
fees of opening and closing that channel

724
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,520
can cut into

725
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,200
kind of what you're trying to do you can

726
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,720
open smaller channels of course you can

727
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,159
do five hundred thousand two hundred and

728
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,679
fifty thousand sats

729
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:37,679
it just depends on what you're trying to

730
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:40,080
do and i like to have

731
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:41,520
slightly bigger channels so that i don't

732
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:45,039
run into bottlenecks

733
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:48,080
if i'm trying to send out so i'm gonna

734
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:50,640
do a million sats and

735
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,360
it says do you want to push tokens to a

736
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,520
partner

737
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,880
so this means if i want to also pay the

738
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,960
person in the process

739
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:59,200
while i'm setting up this channel that's

740
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,440
not the case we'll look at that later

741
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,120
now the type is this public or private

742
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:06,640
it's public it's fine

743
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:10,000
uh and then the fee the fee for uh

744
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:13,520
setting up the channel so the on-chain

745
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,600
transaction fee and so i will uh

746
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,039
open up the mempool here just to kind of

747
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:20,159
see where we're at now

748
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:20,640
fees right now are high okay it's a

749
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,919
little bit

750
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:25,919
busier today i will eat the fees

751
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:27,840
on opening these channels today because

752
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:28,559
i'm trying to get this tutorial done and

753
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,320
over with

754
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:31,840
but if you're setting up your note it's

755
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,400
in your best interest to wait till a

756
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,559
time

757
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,080
when the mempool kind of clears out a

758
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:37,720
little bit we did see that over the

759
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,120
weekend weekends tend to be a good time

760
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,640
particularly on

761
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,240
sundays it tends to clear out a little

762
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,279
bit so keep that in mind as you're

763
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,760
setting up your node

764
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:46,960
you can save some on fees if you're

765
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:49,600
waiting out here

766
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,240
for me you know i'm i want to get into

767
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,159
this

768
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:55,520
next couple of blocks here so i'm

769
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:55,520
probably going to drop

770
00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:00,559
70 or 80 sats per bite i know that's uh

771
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,200
a lot i am overpaying a little bit but

772
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:06,159
that's okay

773
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:06,159
so you know i'll take that hit

774
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:11,279
okay and then that's it i have it's a

775
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,279
new pier

776
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:14,640
i have the information to connect i have

777
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:17,520
the channel size

778
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,640
um and then i have my sats per byte to

779
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,480
what i'm paying for my feed

780
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:23,600
open the channel i'm going to go ahead

781
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:26,000
and hit the open channel button

782
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,840
takes a second to process we should get

783
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,480
a notification in the top right corner

784
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:32,000
there we go

785
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:35,760
channel opened and now

786
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:38,159
if we go to channels

787
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,360
up at the top here what you'll see this

788
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:42,000
is a list of

789
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:43,679
all of your open channels any pending

790
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,159
channels and any closed channels so you

791
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:48,480
can see i already do have channels open

792
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:51,200
for you right now this will be blank but

793
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:53,360
you can click on pending

794
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,880
and you will and if it doesn't show you

795
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,720
just hit refresh

796
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,080
and then it will show and go back to

797
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:01,600
pending there we go

798
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:04,960
okay so i can see my pending channel

799
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:07,840
with cryptoconomy yes indeed the

800
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,679
bitcoin audible mr guy swann so that is

801
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,840
pending if i click on it

802
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:13,279
i get a drop down of all of the

803
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:16,400
information about it

804
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:17,440
um about his node capacity everything so

805
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:22,080
on and so forth

806
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:25,440
and i can even copy the transaction id

807
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:26,720
and go over to mempool and just paste it

808
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,799
in

809
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,919
and now i can watch that transaction

810
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:32,720
what will happen is

811
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:33,360
once it's confirmed and i believe it

812
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,480
needs

813
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:39,360
two confirmations if i'm not mistaken

814
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,240
once it is confirmed um with a couple

815
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,760
confirmations

816
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,159
then that channel will be open and i

817
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,720
will be able to use it as liquidity to

818
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:47,039
send

819
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,080
transactions out now keep in mind here

820
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:51,279
guy swann has not

821
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:52,640
opened a channel with me yet wink wink

822
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:54,720
nudge nudge guy

823
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,640
uh but that means that with this

824
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,360
particular channel i'll be able to send

825
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,520
out

826
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:01,200
but not receive and we'll cover that

827
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:04,559
portion of it later

828
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:06,080
as we look at other channels so we will

829
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:08,399
continue to check on this

830
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:10,880
uh once it opens but in the meantime

831
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:12,080
let's look at how to open a channel in a

832
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:15,440
different way

833
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:16,240
so we're gonna go back to thunderhub

834
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,760
here

835
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:20,080
we'll just go back to home so we can

836
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:22,880
kind of recenter ourselves

837
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:24,880
and what we want to do is we're going to

838
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:27,360
be opening a channel

839
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,080
with another individual but we're going

840
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,360
to do

841
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:33,760
a push payment as we do it and so what

842
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,360
that means is i'm locking up bitcoin in

843
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:38,080
a lightning channel

844
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:39,919
and i'm simultaneously shifting some of

845
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,799
that bitcoin to the ownership of

846
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:42,960
somebody else

847
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:44,480
at the same time so the reason you might

848
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:47,200
do this is

849
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,919
one if you already owe somebody some

850
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,520
sats

851
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:51,440
and you want to open a lightning channel

852
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,159
with them you can pay them at the same

853
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,000
time

854
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:55,679
and you can designate that as we set it

855
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,399
up or

856
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:59,600
if you would like to set up a lightning

857
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:02,960
channel with somebody

858
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:04,960
mutually who you know and you agree that

859
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,840
okay we want the channel to be well

860
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,240
balanced so we

861
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,200
both can send back and forth right off

862
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,840
the hop

863
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:14,000
what you can do is you can push half of

864
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:16,000
it half of the liquidity

865
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,840
uh over to the other individual and then

866
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,559
they can send you a regular bitcoin

867
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,399
transaction

868
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:22,640
back so let's say you were opening a

869
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:23,760
channel for two million sats with

870
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,799
somebody

871
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:28,320
and you want them that you want a

872
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:30,720
well-balanced channel

873
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:32,799
as you open it you can push one million

874
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,399
of those sats half of it to the person

875
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:36,320
in the lightning channel and then

876
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:38,159
they'll send you a transaction to your

877
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,960
regular bitcoin wallet for 1 million

878
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:42,320
sets

879
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:44,640
so you both have the spending ability

880
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:46,720
and the receiving ability and you're all

881
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:49,279
squared off and even so nobody's losing

882
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:51,760
money in that transaction

883
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:52,640
so let's take a look at how to do that

884
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,200
again

885
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,320
we go down and i have an individual same

886
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,880
idea here

887
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,679
i want to open a channel with this

888
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,640
individual

889
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:04,320
i currently owe them some sats and so

890
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,159
this is their node

891
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:07,760
and this is the information that they

892
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:10,799
sent me in terms of

893
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:13,039
the connection info and again you don't

894
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:14,640
have to open up one ml if somebody sends

895
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:17,039
you the information but i just wanted to

896
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:19,440
represent it on the screen here

897
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:23,840
and just as before on our main home

898
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,840
screen we go to open

899
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,120
and manual will hit the open button

900
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:32,640
again

901
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:34,720
now is this a new peer yes it is

902
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:37,279
you paste in the information for the

903
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,399
node now what is the channel size going

904
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:43,200
to be i'm going to

905
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:45,039
do another 1 million sat channel

906
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,360
now this is the part where we use the

907
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:50,880
push tokens to partner

908
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:53,919
option so in this case it's a specific

909
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,799
number of sats that i'm pushing to this

910
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:57,200
person

911
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:57,840
um so i'm not going to do the half i'm

912
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,679
going to do

913
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:06,640
custom and 41

914
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:08,320
31 5. so 41 315 sets

915
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,240
is what is outstanding what i owe this

916
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,919
individual and that will get pushed to

917
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,960
them as i open this

918
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:15,440
and then what do we need for sats per

919
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,240
byte

920
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:20,799
again this one i'm not in as much of a

921
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,799
rush oh

922
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:25,440
there's i don't know if you heard the

923
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:27,120
little uh queue there but my transaction

924
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,039
was just confirmed from before

925
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,559
um i'm not in as much of a rush with

926
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:31,760
this channel so i'll set it a little bit

927
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:34,720
lower i'll probably do about

928
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:36,159
30 sats per byte should probably do me

929
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:39,200
maybe

930
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:41,120
yeah maybe 30 sets per byte okay so i'll

931
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:44,559
just put that information in

932
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:46,159
30. everything else looks good to me so

933
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:47,840
i'm going to go ahead and i'm gonna hit

934
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:50,960
open channel

935
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,960
just as before

936
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:55,120
okay channel is opened and so what i've

937
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,480
done

938
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,000
is i've opened a channel with this

939
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,000
individual let's go into our channels

940
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:03,039
over on the left hand side here and

941
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:07,279
go into pending just hit a quick

942
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:09,919
refresh there pending one more time

943
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:12,000
okay there is the new channel that i've

944
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:16,080
just opened up i can click on it

945
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:19,200
and again uh if i want i can

946
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:21,360
track that transaction by copying the

947
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,200
transaction id here

948
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,559
and heading over to

949
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,080
[Music]

950
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:28,640
mempool.space let's just have a

951
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,919
different window for it and i can just

952
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:32,919
track that by the way

953
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:34,240
the reason i'm opening a new window this

954
00:32:32,919 --> 00:32:37,200
mempool.space is

955
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:39,039
linked to the umbral node so it's like a

956
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,720
private kind of set of data

957
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:42,559
rather than connecting to the internet

958
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:46,320
but if you just click

959
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:48,000
on the transaction id it will open up in

960
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:51,120
the regular website as well

961
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,240
okay um so anyways there's my

962
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:54,960
transaction

963
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,000
waiting to get through but effectively

964
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,720
what i've done is i've paid

965
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,480
this person as i open up the channel and

966
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,600
once that channel is open they will see

967
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:04,799
that they have

968
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:08,000
uh 41 000 sats on their side of it so i

969
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:10,000
have paid them at the same time

970
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,039
perfect so we basically have two

971
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,399
channels

972
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:16,720
now just waiting to be confirmed and uh

973
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:19,279
and and we're off to the races now there

974
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:22,159
is one other way

975
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:23,120
one other way to go ahead and open a

976
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:26,320
channel

977
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:29,440
and this is actually the first thing

978
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:32,159
i ever did when i started up this

979
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,159
lightning node

980
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,320
what i'm going to do here is i'm going

981
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:39,279
to open a channel with a

982
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:41,360
pretty big node that isn't necessarily a

983
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:43,440
merchant because

984
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:45,039
if i open with a merchant then and i

985
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,360
have a lot of other peers connected to

986
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:47,279
me

987
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:49,519
i may find that that channel drains

988
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:52,480
rather quickly

989
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:53,840
what i want is i want to open up a

990
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:56,720
channel with a large node

991
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:57,440
so one of the largest nodes that's easy

992
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,960
to uh

993
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:03,440
to find go to 1ml right here

994
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:05,120
is async okay and you see it right here

995
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,640
top channel count increase they're

996
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,840
always up top they're one of the biggest

997
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:12,320
nodes out there

998
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:14,320
async right there and

999
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:16,000
it's yeah it's the number one in terms

1000
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,800
of channels so it's the largest

1001
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,599
out there the most for capacity and so

1002
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,359
the reason

1003
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:23,359
i'm going to open a channel with these

1004
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:24,320
individuals is i'm going to do something

1005
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:27,040
called a loop

1006
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:28,159
out and this is kind of like the push

1007
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:31,280
that i just did

1008
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:33,359
with the last opening channel um where

1009
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:36,639
i'm going to create a channel

1010
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:37,359
with a large amount of sats allocated to

1011
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:39,040
it

1012
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:40,560
but then i'm going to use a service

1013
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:44,159
called lightning loop

1014
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:47,440
to send bitcoin through that channel

1015
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:50,240
to async and then route it to

1016
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:51,040
lightning labs and lightning labs in

1017
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:53,520
turn

1018
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:54,320
will then send me a regular bitcoin

1019
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:57,680
transaction

1020
00:34:54,320 --> 00:35:00,240
back now why might i do this same reason

1021
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:02,400
as wanting a balanced channel before

1022
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:05,040
this is so that i have a large amount of

1023
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,440
inbound capacity so i can accept a lot

1024
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,200
of

1025
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,480
payments via lightning network in the

1026
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,079
future

1027
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:12,000
and so this is what i did actually we

1028
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:15,599
can even go and look at my

1029
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:19,040
my async channel from before

1030
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:22,480
so we can see it is right here up top

1031
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:25,839
so this was a 10 million satoshi channel

1032
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:29,280
and i opened that initially and

1033
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:30,960
uh then i looped out 8 million sats so i

1034
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:33,359
still had some spending capacity

1035
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,160
but you can see now the balance started

1036
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:37,359
to shift

1037
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:40,400
on my side there's 3.2 million and on

1038
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:43,520
their side there's 6.8 million

1039
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,000
so this means that i can accept 6.8

1040
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,839
million

1041
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,359
sats worth of payments through this

1042
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:49,520
particular channel

1043
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:50,800
so if this is seeming a little bit over

1044
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:53,680
your head let's just go through the

1045
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:55,440
steps and see what it looks like

1046
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,720
so i've got the async node right here

1047
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,079
this is the information i need to

1048
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:01,280
connect to them

1049
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:04,320
i'm going to copy that information

1050
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:07,680
now i'm going to go over to thunderhub

1051
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:09,760
i'm going to go channels

1052
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:11,119
then i'm going to or sorry i'm going to

1053
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:14,320
go home rather

1054
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:14,320
and i'm going to go to the open

1055
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:22,160
at this point we're going to

1056
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:23,760
hit the manual open as well

1057
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:25,280
now this is the interesting part if i

1058
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,079
was opening up a channel with somebody

1059
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,800
i'm already connected

1060
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:29,200
to i would do the drop down and i can

1061
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:33,520
see

1062
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:35,119
async is in here right there

1063
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:36,800
that's the same information as before

1064
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:38,839
it's the same node everything

1065
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,880
i could designate a certain number of

1066
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:42,960
sats

1067
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,880
1 million 10 million whatever it's going

1068
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,960
to be

1069
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,160
i'm not going to push because we're

1070
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:50,880
doing a loop

1071
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:52,960
if i push in this case i don't know

1072
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,000
who's at async nobody knows that i'm

1073
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,640
doing this they'll just have

1074
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,320
extra money and they won't know why so

1075
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:01,359
this is not what i'm trying to do

1076
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:02,960
okay so i'm not pushing

1077
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:04,640
and then you would set your sas per byte

1078
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,480
and you would open a channel

1079
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,240
let's just pretend i already went

1080
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:11,119
through those steps and

1081
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:14,160
we're going to refer back to my already

1082
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:16,160
open channel with async

1083
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,920
so let's just pretend that i had opened

1084
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:21,440
a channel

1085
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:25,119
and i already had

1086
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:29,119
funds allocated to async here and

1087
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:32,720
it was a 3.2 million satoshi channel

1088
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:34,960
okay i want some of that back

1089
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:37,280
so that i can open up other channels in

1090
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:39,040
the future i just want the ability to

1091
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,720
receive the funds through async because

1092
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:43,760
they're really well connected

1093
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:46,320
well what can we do we can use

1094
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,520
something called and let me re-log into

1095
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:50,720
my umbrella here

1096
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:54,000
we can use something called lightning

1097
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,960
loop or something through lightning labs

1098
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,960
called loop

1099
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,400
and so this is in the app store it is

1100
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,920
lightning terminal that's the one that

1101
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,520
you want you just download it i've

1102
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:04,400
already downloaded it

1103
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:05,920
i can click on it and log in by the way

1104
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:08,160
the default password on

1105
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:11,040
umbral unless you change it is money

1106
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,040
printer go burr

1107
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,800
okay and this is lightning terminal i'm

1108
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,480
not going to get super deep into exactly

1109
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,520
all that's here this will be a future

1110
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,920
video as well

1111
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:25,599
but may be useful for some of you

1112
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,839
setting up your first channels

1113
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:29,280
so let's assume that you created a large

1114
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:31,440
channel with async

1115
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:33,280
and all of the capacity is on your side

1116
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:36,000
so you can spend out pretty easily but

1117
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:39,200
you still can't receive payments

1118
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,880
you can change that balance by

1119
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:43,359
on the first tab here under lightning

1120
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:46,000
terminal hitting the loop button

1121
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:48,560
you're gonna find that channel that is

1122
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,560
async

1123
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:54,000
and then you're going to choose loop out

1124
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,960
this is where you're taking money out of

1125
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,480
lightning network

1126
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:58,720
and back into your regular bitcoin

1127
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,000
wallet now right here

1128
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:03,119
you're going to choose the amount of

1129
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,960
sats i'm just going to do 1 million sats

1130
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:06,720
because i've got about 3 million in

1131
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:09,040
capacity to send out i don't want to

1132
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:11,680
pull too much out of that for right now

1133
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:13,760
it is in your best interest to pull a

1134
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,079
larger amount in that it cuts down on

1135
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,760
the

1136
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:17,280
fees that you're gonna pay here you've

1137
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:20,400
got two fees to contend with

1138
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:24,640
the the loop fee which is half a percent

1139
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:27,119
and the on chain transaction fee okay

1140
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:27,760
if you want under additional options

1141
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:30,240
here

1142
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,880
you can set a confirmation target so if

1143
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,800
you're

1144
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:35,040
not interested in waiting a super long

1145
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:36,720
or if you don't mind waiting a super

1146
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:39,520
long time and you want lower fees

1147
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:40,640
sure you can put in a certain number of

1148
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,480
blocks

1149
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:44,400
or you can change the address that you

1150
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:47,200
would like to receive to

1151
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,520
the default is just the address of your

1152
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,520
own

1153
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:51,599
umbrella node which i'm going to leave

1154
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:55,119
so i'm not going to change anything here

1155
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:57,599
i'm going to hit next i can see

1156
00:39:55,119 --> 00:40:00,880
yes it is gonna be a bit of a steep fee

1157
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:02,560
it's 1.67 percent of the total lot

1158
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:04,240
and a good portion of that is just the

1159
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:07,280
on-chain fee because

1160
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:07,920
i'm not optimizing for what i'm doing

1161
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,160
right now

1162
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:11,520
again ideally i'd be doing a larger

1163
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:14,560
chunk of

1164
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:15,839
a larger channel but hey that's okay

1165
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:18,960
this just for

1166
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:20,160
educational purposes so anyways um i'm

1167
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,720
gonna go ahead i

1168
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:23,359
this is fine i'll eat the fee for right

1169
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:27,040
now

1170
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:28,079
and i'm going to hit confirm and so what

1171
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:30,800
this does

1172
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:32,240
is it's saying to lightning labs hey

1173
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:35,359
this person

1174
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:36,720
will send you 1 million sats via

1175
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:40,160
lightning

1176
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:43,440
plus a fee if you send them

1177
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:45,920
one million sats to their own bitcoin

1178
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,560
wallet and that's what's taking place

1179
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,560
right now

1180
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:50,000
okay so this does take a while to

1181
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:53,119
execute um

1182
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,880
sometimes it can be quite a while i i

1183
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:56,960
think i've waited an hour for this

1184
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:58,640
previously but that's because also

1185
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:00,240
you're you're settling on chain

1186
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,920
lightning labs has their own thing in

1187
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:04,800
the background that does loop

1188
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:06,000
so it's it's a useful tool if you're

1189
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:09,359
trying to get

1190
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:12,000
inbound capacity while setting up your

1191
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:13,119
node and you maybe don't have peers yet

1192
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,240
that want to

1193
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:17,599
open up channels with you so use the

1194
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:20,720
tools that you have

1195
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:23,280
we will check back on this momentarily

1196
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:26,400
once all of this gets sorted including

1197
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,400
those earlier channels

1198
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:31,119
all right when the loop is finished you

1199
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:34,160
will see the loops complete

1200
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:37,839
thing here that is all set um

1201
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:43,040
i can head back to umbrol and if i go

1202
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:43,040
to my home uh i should see

1203
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:49,200
yep there is in my bitcoin wallet a

1204
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:52,000
deposit

1205
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:53,599
just shy of a million sats so they

1206
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,160
actually take the fee

1207
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:58,319
from the million that i looped out so

1208
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:01,599
there's the deposit eight minutes ago

1209
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:04,240
that came in uh so that is all set i can

1210
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:07,599
also see that my older transaction

1211
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:10,480
opening a channel with guy swann is

1212
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:11,280
very well confirmed as well as the other

1213
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,359
the other

1214
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:15,520
transaction opening the channel with the

1215
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:16,079
person that i pushed a payment to so

1216
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:19,200
those are

1217
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:20,480
both all set so let's take a look in

1218
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:23,760
thunderhub and again

1219
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:25,359
just to refresh you moving from our home

1220
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:28,319
screen here you would just go to

1221
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:30,240
channels on the left hand side and i can

1222
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:32,960
see here

1223
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:35,200
uh the async one remember it was two

1224
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:37,200
point around two point three million

1225
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,240
well or it was three point three million

1226
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,480
sats was on my

1227
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:41,599
side of the channel well now that has

1228
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:43,839
shifted over

1229
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:46,079
so i sent a million through that channel

1230
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:49,200
to pay lightning labs

1231
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:52,800
and that was paid back to me main chain

1232
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:56,079
now i also i believe can scroll down i

1233
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:56,079
just got to find them here

1234
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,000
there's crypt economy there we go

1235
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:03,520
there's that channel that i just opened

1236
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:06,720
there and i can't remember the name

1237
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:07,359
of the other channel that i had it

1238
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:09,599
should be

1239
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:11,599
somewhere around here there it is right

1240
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:13,359
there 41.3 k

1241
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:14,960
so there's that push payment so i opened

1242
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:15,920
a channel and i paid the person at the

1243
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,640
same time

1244
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:19,760
so we basically have opened three

1245
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:22,160
channels

1246
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:24,240
uh in three different ways we have done

1247
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:25,920
it with a regular open where all the

1248
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:27,280
capacity stays on my side and i can

1249
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:29,440
spend easily

1250
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:31,200
we've done it with a push payment where

1251
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:33,599
i paid somebody in the process

1252
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:34,319
splitting up some of the capacity and

1253
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:37,200
then we've done

1254
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:37,680
a regular channel open with a loop out

1255
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,400
which

1256
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:42,079
got me bitcoin back on the main chain

1257
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,680
while maintaining some liquidity in the

1258
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:44,480
channel so i can receive lightning

1259
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:47,680
payments

1260
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:49,440
later fun okay

1261
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:51,920
in the process we did get some inbound

1262
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:55,200
liquidity but really quick let's review

1263
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:58,800
how somebody might connect with you

1264
00:43:55,200 --> 00:44:00,880
in order to get capacity uh on

1265
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:02,079
their side to be able to send out and

1266
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:04,560
you'll notice

1267
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:05,760
in my channels you'll notice some of

1268
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:07,440
them where

1269
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:09,040
all of the capacity is on the other side

1270
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,520
and this is a channel where somebody has

1271
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:12,160
opened

1272
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:13,440
with me and all of the bitcoin is on

1273
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:15,359
their side but if they

1274
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:17,200
route a payment through my node we will

1275
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:18,560
notice that shift over and start to

1276
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:21,839
spill

1277
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:22,720
into the my side of the channel you can

1278
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:25,119
also

1279
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:28,000
see let's see bitcoiner support open a

1280
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:30,319
channel with me mr nice node myno btc

1281
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,280
so there's a number of individuals that

1282
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:33,040
have opened

1283
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:35,119
channels with me where there hasn't been

1284
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:36,880
a movement of funds as of yet

1285
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:39,280
but there's a lot of different channels

1286
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:41,280
anything in blue is on my side

1287
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,960
meaning that i can spend anything in

1288
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:46,079
green is on their side

1289
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:48,800
meaning that i can receive or they can

1290
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:50,800
all be used to route payments from

1291
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,839
others that are just connected us to us

1292
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,920
in some way

1293
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:55,839
without costing me any money in fact you

1294
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:58,960
actually can gain some fees

1295
00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:59,920
from doing that now again for somebody

1296
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,760
to connect to you

1297
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:04,000
all you need to do go to your home

1298
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:05,520
screen you can copy your public key

1299
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,760
and give them that or you can just hit

1300
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:10,079
the copy onion button and that

1301
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:12,079
copies the entire chain that they need

1302
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:15,599
to connect directly to you

1303
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:18,160
and that's pretty much it

1304
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:18,640
now in terms of in inbound capacity you

1305
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,400
can do

1306
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:21,920
it other ways as well so if you can't

1307
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:24,000
find somebody to connect to you

1308
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:25,839
i highly recommend that you do try that

1309
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,720
uh jump on bitcoin twitter start

1310
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:28,880
tweeting out

1311
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:30,079
uh tag a few people see who you can find

1312
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:33,200
there are telegrams

1313
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:33,599
groups for this type of stuff so be sure

1314
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,440
to

1315
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:36,720
to look around you'll definitely be able

1316
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:40,160
to find some people

1317
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:42,000
however you can also rent

1318
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:43,359
inbound liquidity so if you're a

1319
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,040
merchant and you know you're going to be

1320
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:46,960
accepting a lot of different lightning

1321
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:48,160
lightning payments but you don't have

1322
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:51,040
inbound liquidity

1323
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:52,000
liquidity you can actually rent that um

1324
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:54,480
you can do it through

1325
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,040
somebody like bit refill they do have

1326
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:58,240
thor

1327
00:45:55,040 --> 00:46:00,160
channels and basically it's you paying

1328
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:01,760
to have them lock up their bitcoin and

1329
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,240
open a channel with you so that you can

1330
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,880
receive

1331
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:06,560
payments you don't have to do this but

1332
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:07,760
if you're in a pinch might be an option

1333
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:10,160
so you can see

1334
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:11,760
about 11 or 12 bucks to get a 1 million

1335
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:14,400
sat channel open to you

1336
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:17,040
now this does have some limitations they

1337
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:20,079
will keep it open for 30 days

1338
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:22,240
if there is no movement on that channel

1339
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:22,880
if there's no consistent movement of

1340
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:24,720
funds

1341
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:26,160
then they may close the channel on you

1342
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:28,800
so just keep that in mind

1343
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:29,440
um this isn't like the the best way to

1344
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,440
do it

1345
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:32,560
but it is definitely an option

1346
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:35,040
alternatively

1347
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:37,680
we were on uh we were on lightning

1348
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:40,000
terminal and this will be a future video

1349
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:41,040
but you can actually uh join a

1350
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,440
marketplace

1351
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:44,240
and pay individuals to lock up their

1352
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:46,400
bitcoin

1353
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:47,920
and open channels with you using

1354
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:49,680
lightning pool

1355
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:51,440
but that is for another day and i

1356
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:55,040
digress so we're going to

1357
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:56,880
uh finish up with the channel talk and

1358
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:59,119
let's assume that it took you a little

1359
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:00,880
while to kind of get things

1360
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:02,640
under control and get some channels

1361
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:04,400
going it may take you a while to get

1362
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:07,280
yourself well set up

1363
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:09,680
but once you start having some capacity

1364
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:10,960
on both sides with some well connected

1365
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:13,760
channels

1366
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:15,280
then it's time to start doing

1367
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:18,240
transactions and that's what we're going

1368
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:18,240
to take a look at next

1369
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:24,079
so to receive transactions directly to

1370
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:26,480
your lightning node

1371
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:27,760
really simple just from your home screen

1372
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:29,440
under your accounts

1373
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:32,079
and then the lightning account here

1374
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:34,079
there is a receive button

1375
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:36,160
and you're going to create a lightning

1376
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:37,520
invoice for a certain number of sats

1377
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:39,520
that you would like to receive

1378
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:41,119
i'm just going to do a small one for

1379
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:42,960
1000 satoshi's

1380
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:44,640
you can enter a description if you like

1381
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,760
or an expiry i'm not going to do either

1382
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,720
of those things i'm just going to go

1383
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:49,440
ahead and hit

1384
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:50,800
create invoice now this gives me a

1385
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:52,960
lightning invoice in

1386
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:54,319
text which i could hit the copy button

1387
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:55,599
and then i could paste that into a

1388
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:58,319
message to somebody

1389
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:59,359
or for a certain amount of time it

1390
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:02,319
counts down

1391
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:03,359
this qr code will be available as well

1392
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:05,839
so just within

1393
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:07,440
i'm using blue wallet right now just as

1394
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:10,079
a proof of concept

1395
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:12,559
i'm going to do a quick scan of that i

1396
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:14,960
can see the invoice pops up on my wallet

1397
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:18,240
and tells me it's a thousand sats

1398
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:19,839
and i'm just gonna hit pay and that

1399
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:22,960
should show up

1400
00:48:19,839 --> 00:48:25,040
in no time at all hopefully approved

1401
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:27,839
via my node so there we go i can see it

1402
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:30,000
says paid and it says the same

1403
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:31,440
on my phone sorry for the reflection but

1404
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:35,040
you get the point

1405
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:36,640
so that's how you receive regularly via

1406
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:38,400
an invoice and you can do that for any

1407
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:39,760
amount that you like assuming that you

1408
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:42,640
have the capacity

1409
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:44,079
to receive that via one of your channels

1410
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:46,960
now another way

1411
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:48,000
and this is an interesting one that you

1412
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:51,200
can do

1413
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:54,880
is key send

1414
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:58,559
now what is key send key send is

1415
00:48:54,880 --> 00:49:00,720
somebody sending directly to your node

1416
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:02,480
so let me just get my information here

1417
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:05,760
my node information

1418
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:06,400
okay so i'm going to copy that i'm going

1419
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:09,839
to

1420
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:11,839
head right over to 1ml that website

1421
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:14,000
we've been using

1422
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:16,079
and there's my node okay and this is my

1423
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:19,680
node information key send allows you to

1424
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:22,400
send directly to an individual's node

1425
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:23,599
without having to create invoices now

1426
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:26,720
i'm going to be doing this

1427
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:28,480
via breeze okay via breeze wallet

1428
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:31,040
this is another lightning wall that i've

1429
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:33,520
done tutorials on i've got about 10

1430
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:34,079
000 sats sitting in it right now and i'm

1431
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:36,000
gonna try

1432
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:38,079
sending over just ten or not ten

1433
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:41,040
thousand just a thousand sats

1434
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:42,240
via key sent now not every lightning

1435
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:44,960
wallet allows for this

1436
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:47,040
there are certain reasons why there's no

1437
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:48,480
payment trail when it comes to key sand

1438
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:49,119
somebody could pretend that you didn't

1439
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:52,079
pay them

1440
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:52,720
so this is probably better used for like

1441
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:54,079
tipping

1442
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:56,319
all right so if you're going to give

1443
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:57,119
somebody a tip then you can do a key

1444
00:49:56,319 --> 00:50:00,400
send

1445
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:01,920
directly to their node all right and

1446
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:03,599
if you want them to notice it you might

1447
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,240
want to let them know that you did it

1448
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:06,160
okay

1449
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:07,760
but for this i can just hit the scan

1450
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:10,640
button and i can simply

1451
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:12,400
scan the node and then it prompts me

1452
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:14,160
within breeze

1453
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:16,400
how much do you want to send so i'm just

1454
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:18,000
going to hit 1000

1455
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:19,440
and i'm going to hit pay and it says are

1456
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,720
you sure you want to send a thousand

1457
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:23,520
sats to this node

1458
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:24,079
and i confirm that and then it will

1459
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,000
create

1460
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:27,520
what's known as a key send transaction

1461
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,920
direct to that node

1462
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:31,040
there will be no notifications or

1463
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:33,119
anything like that

1464
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:34,480
but if i go back and i look in my

1465
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:37,440
transactions

1466
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:37,760
on my node uh then i will see it it does

1467
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:40,480
say

1468
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:41,839
payment was successfully sent so i can

1469
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:45,040
head over

1470
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:47,359
and i should be able to

1471
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:48,160
uh just hit refresh here and see if i've

1472
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:51,359
got an

1473
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:51,359
incoming transaction

1474
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:55,520
indeed okay so i can see there's a

1475
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:58,880
thousand sats

1476
00:50:55,520 --> 00:51:02,319
uh coming in from 16 seconds ago

1477
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:05,040
so all set um that has been received

1478
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:06,079
and two different ways to receive via

1479
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:08,480
lightning

1480
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:11,359
now what about sending out that's what

1481
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:11,359
we're going to do next

1482
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:17,200
so let's practice spending or

1483
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:18,880
sending out some lightning transactions

1484
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:21,119
from our node now that we're all well

1485
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:24,000
connected and we know we can receive

1486
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:24,640
so um i have brought up something i just

1487
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,800
want to buy

1488
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:28,640
uh this is bitcoinshirt.com and they

1489
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:31,440
have a red hoodie here

1490
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:31,920
hashtag reckless with a lightning symbol

1491
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:34,000
so

1492
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:35,359
why not let's let's grab this so i've

1493
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:38,800
already gone through

1494

00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:44,880
invoice here and any time that you're uh

1496
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:46,640
spending bitcoin oftentimes with btc

1497
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:48,960
pays over you can toggle between

1498
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:50,319
bitcoin and lightning network so this is

1499
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:53,440
a lightning network

1500
00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:56,319
invoice i can just hit copy here

1501
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:57,920
and it is a bolt 11 invoice if i just

1502
00:51:56,319 --> 00:51:59,200
tap that it will copy all that

1503
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:02,880
information

1504
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:05,920
i can then head over to my thunderhub

1505
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:08,960
and we're going to in your accounts

1506
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:12,000
under lightning we're going to hit send

1507
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:15,520
now if you want you can actually go down

1508
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:18,000
and hit decode and paste in

1509
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:18,960
your addre or your invoice here and

1510
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,960
it'll tell you

1511
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:22,240
what's going on what you're sending who

1512
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:24,240
you're sending to

1513
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:26,400
so on and so forth so here it says hey

1514
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:29,520
it's going to be paid to bitcoin shirt

1515
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:32,640
store um there it's a counting down

1516
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:34,559
here's the amount um all of this stuff

1517
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:36,640
it lets you know kind of

1518
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:37,839
what's going what the hops are going to

1519
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:40,079
be in between

1520
00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:41,680
what's likely to happen so and so forth

1521
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:43,040
so we're going to just try this out this

1522
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:46,400
looks all good to me

1523
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:49,520
i'm going to paste in that invoice

1524
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:52,720
now what is the max fee that you would

1525
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:55,680
uh like to pay so again

1526
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:56,480
with each hop there may be you may be

1527
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:59,520
incurring

1528
00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:00,559
like a satoshi or two fee so i don't

1529
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:03,680
mind

1530
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:06,240
having a fee that is

1531
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:06,720
you know a a few sats or whatever it may

1532
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:10,000
be

1533
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:12,559
so i'm gonna set my my fee to

1534
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,119
uh a hundred sats it's not gonna be that

1535
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:14,640
much

1536
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:17,280
probably but it kind of gives me that

1537
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:18,319
wiggle room max pass i usually just

1538
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:20,800
leave this at one

1539
00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:22,480
and if you want to you can choose which

1540
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:24,720
channel it goes out through

1541
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:26,640
but just be aware if you choose one that

1542
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:28,160
doesn't have the liquidity or the path

1543
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:29,599
you may have a failed payment so let's

1544
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:30,160
just try that out i'm going to go ahead

1545
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:34,079
i'm going to hit

1546
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:36,400
pay all right payment is sent

1547
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:38,079
let's jump back over to that invoice

1548
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:40,559
invoice has been paid

1549
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:42,160
all good so we were able to successfully

1550
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:43,520
send out i'll have myself a new hoodie

1551
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:45,599
whenever that ships out

1552
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:47,119
great that's fantastic i'm going to

1553
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:50,559
close these

1554
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:54,000
out so that is one way

1555
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:56,240
to pay now i previously mentioned

1556
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,040
receiving via key send now we're going

1557
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:59,200
to actually

1558
00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:01,520
send a transaction via key send and

1559
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:03,200
again this is better used i'd say for

1560
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:06,240
tips more than anything

1561
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:08,559
uh but i digress let's take a look here

1562
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:10,800
so there is an awesome dude who spent

1563
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:11,440
some time with me teaching me a lot of

1564
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:13,280
this stuff

1565
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:14,720
and i'm still very new to a lot of it

1566
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:17,119
but he was uh

1567
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:18,400
kind enough to sit down on a call with

1568
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:21,760
me for like

1569
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:22,960
oh well over an hour to uh explain a lot

1570
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:25,440
about thunderhub and

1571
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:26,240
and help me wrap my head around of it um

1572
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:29,280
his name

1573
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:32,240
is nate uh and on twitter at beef

1574
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:35,440
or bacon one uh well worth a follow he

1575
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:37,440
was also on bitcoin kindergarten podcast

1576
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:38,720
you can find the episode on youtube and

1577
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:40,240
any other podcast

1578
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:42,559
where he explains a lot of what we're

1579
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:43,599
going through today anyways i appreciate

1580
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:46,000
him and his time

1581
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:47,200
so let's do a key sent to his node which

1582
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,280
i have pulled up here

1583
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:50,960
and all we need is we just need the

1584
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:52,960
public key of that node so i'm going to

1585
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:54,640
copy that right now

1586
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:56,319
we'll jump back to thunderhub and just

1587
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:58,319
as before we go into

1588
00:54:56,319 --> 00:54:59,760
our main page your accounts under

1589
00:54:58,319 --> 00:55:01,599
lightning we're going to hit

1590
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:03,280
send the first thing we're going to do

1591
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:03,680
it says is this a key send we're going

1592
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:06,079
to hit

1593
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:07,119
yes this time and then we're going to

1594
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:11,040
paste in

1595
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:14,160
the public key we're going to hit decode

1596
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:17,280
and at that point it says hey uh

1597
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:17,760
how much do you want to send so um you

1598
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:20,480
know

1599
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:21,520
he was pretty awesome with me so i'm

1600
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:25,359
gonna go ahead

1601
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:26,960
i'm gonna send the dude 50 000 sats

1602
00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:29,680
all right so we'll shoot that off we'll

1603
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:29,680
just hit send

1604
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:34,960
payment sent so there you go 50k sass

1605
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:36,880
dude thank you for your time

1606
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:38,079
much appreciated uh and i highly

1607
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:40,240
recommend everybody go

1608
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:41,920
check it out um of course unless he

1609
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:42,480
watches this he may not realize that has

1610
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:45,920
happened

1611
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:47,680
but uh either way i i hope he enjoys the

1612
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:49,839
sets

1613
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:51,920
so that is sending now i did want to

1614
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:54,079
reiterate a couple other things about

1615
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:56,000
sending so just taking a look at the

1616
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:58,960
send screen when we hit send

1617
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,440
i kind of glossed over the the max paths

1618
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:03,599
thing

1619
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:06,960
earlier what this does is if you try to

1620
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:09,599
send a transaction through a single path

1621
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:11,200
just going through one node to the next

1622
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:13,119
node to the next node to the next node

1623
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:15,040
you may run into bottlenecks and that

1624
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:16,720
means you may run into instances

1625
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:18,720
where there's not enough capacity to

1626
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:20,079
just jump from node to node to send off

1627
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:23,119
a transaction

1628
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:24,000
if that fails you can bump up this

1629
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:27,119
number

1630
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:30,480
and what that means is maybe if you go

1631
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:31,200
just two to two paths it means it splits

1632
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:33,760
your payment

1633
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:34,960
amongst different channels and can go

1634
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:37,440
out and then coalesce

1635
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:38,000
on that singular destination so you're

1636
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:39,760
paying

1637
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,680
through two different routes the reason

1638
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:44,640
you may not do this initially

1639
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:46,160
is because it can incur higher fees but

1640
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:47,760
keep that in mind and you can tinker

1641
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:48,799
with these numbers as you go to try and

1642
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:49,839
get your payment to go through

1643
00:56:48,799 --> 00:56:52,960
successfully

1644
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:54,000
if having a relatively low fee and a

1645
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:56,839
single path

1646
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:59,839
does not work for you i hope that makes

1647
00:56:56,839 --> 00:56:59,839
sense

1648
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:06,880
so now that we've basically got a well

1649
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:07,520
set up node we've got lots of channels

1650
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:09,520
in and out

1651
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:11,440
liquidity on both sides of those we've

1652
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:13,119
practiced sending and receiving

1653
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:15,040
transactions

1654
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:16,640
let's dig a little bit deeper into

1655
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:18,799
what's in front of us and what

1656
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:19,280
information and settings we can tinker

1657
00:57:18,799 --> 00:57:21,839
with

1658
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:23,359
within our node okay so what i want to

1659
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:24,960
look at right now is our list of

1660
00:57:23,359 --> 00:57:26,319
channels so over on the left hand side

1661
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:28,880
we click on channels

1662
00:57:26,319 --> 00:57:30,880
and as i'm sure you figured out this is

1663
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:32,799
a list of every channel that we have

1664
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:34,400
open either to us or that we have opened

1665
00:57:32,799 --> 00:57:38,480
with somebody else

1666
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:41,520
and when you hover over this you can see

1667
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:43,760
the local and remote balance anything

1668
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:45,680
blue again is what i can spend that is

1669
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:47,760
local anything green is what i can

1670
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:49,520
receive and that is remote

1671
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:52,160
okay so you can see for instance this

1672
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:55,520
channel up top somebody opened with me

1673
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:58,240
sat base.org apparently 10 million sats

1674
00:57:55,520 --> 00:58:00,240
so i mean looks like they'd like to

1675
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:03,040
route a lot of payments through me

1676
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:05,200
great wonderful but i can know i cannot

1677
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:07,200
spend out through them until some

1678
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:09,280
comes in towards me and i gain some

1679
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:12,160
liquidity there but either way

1680
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:12,960
great um you can see as we go down async

1681
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:14,640
i do have

1682
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:16,160
a little bit more of a balance i can

1683
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:18,960
send out

1684
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:20,880
around 2 million sats and inbound

1685
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:23,440
getting close to around 8 million sats i

1686
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:26,400
can receive

1687
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:27,359
this one in the middle wallet of satoshi

1688
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:30,079
requarts

1689
00:58:27,359 --> 00:58:31,359
pear tree they're all pretty balanced

1690
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:35,440
sending and receiving

1691
00:58:31,359 --> 00:58:37,839
on both ends now you may notice

1692
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:39,440
some of your channels may show up as red

1693
00:58:37,839 --> 00:58:41,599
that means for the time being

1694
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:42,960
the peer is currently offline and you're

1695
00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:43,839
not going to be able to utilize that

1696
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:47,119
channel to

1697
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:48,559
do payments now if i click on any

1698
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:49,119
particular node and we'll just use the

1699
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:51,440
red one

1700
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:53,200
as an example it shows all kinds of

1701
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:55,520
different information here

1702
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:56,480
the local balance and remote balance it

1703
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:58,160
also shows you

1704
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:59,839
how much you've received through this

1705
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:00,720
channel and how much you've sent through

1706
00:58:59,839 --> 00:59:02,480
the channel

1707
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:04,000
and any reserves that have been put off

1708
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:05,920
to the side you can see the

1709
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:08,319
nodes public key which you can click on

1710
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:10,480
and see all their other channels

1711
00:59:08,319 --> 00:59:11,839
the transaction id that was used to open

1712
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:14,079
the channel

1713
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:16,559
you can also and this is relevant for

1714
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:17,520
this offline peer you can see the age of

1715
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:20,240
the channel

1716
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:22,240
and the time offline versus the time

1717
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:24,079
online now this guy's only been offline

1718
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:27,200
for about an hour and a half

1719
00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:29,040
over the past two and a half days

1720
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:31,119
i'm not super worried about that he may

1721
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:32,000
just have had uh internet outage or

1722
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:33,839
something like that right

1723
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,760
now that he's trying to figure out maybe

1724
00:59:33,839 --> 00:59:37,280
he's not home to reboot his router

1725
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:39,359
again not worried but if you see

1726
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:40,559
somebody that's been offline for a vast

1727
00:59:39,359 --> 00:59:42,240
majority

1728
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:44,480
maybe it's time to think about closing

1729
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:47,359
that channel out because the pier is

1730
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:48,880
relatively unresponsive now in order to

1731
00:59:47,359 --> 00:59:50,480
actually close a channel

1732
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:52,240
you can hit the close channel button

1733
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:53,920
down below i'm not going to be doing

1734
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:56,880
this but

1735
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:58,319
if they are responsive you it says do

1736
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:59,760
you want to force close the channel you

1737
00:59:58,319 --> 01:00:01,839
can just keep that on no

1738
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:02,880
and then you just hit a a fee an

1739
01:00:01,839 --> 01:00:04,400
on-chain fee

1740
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:06,480
that you're willing to pay to close out

1741
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:09,440
the channel and then you just hit

1742
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:10,640
close here so i could hit 10 sets per

1743
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:12,880
byte if i'm not in

1744
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:14,000
a rush or whatever and hit close channel

1745
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:16,160
now if the person is

1746
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,839
unresponsive that's when you would hit

1747
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:19,760
yes to force closed channel

1748
01:00:17,839 --> 01:00:21,119
and it will just use the some of the

1749
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:23,680
reserves in order

1750
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:25,440
to close out that channel either way i'm

1751
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:26,079
gonna leave this one running i am happy

1752
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:28,640
with it

1753
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:30,720
and uh that's pretty much that there's

1754
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:33,599
one other thing that you can do

1755
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:34,559
and i want to show you this um in

1756
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:38,799
comparison

1757
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:43,119
okay so let's go to hmm

1758
01:00:38,799 --> 01:00:46,400
let's go to my bit refill channel

1759
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:48,720
okay so you can actually hit update

1760
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:52,400
details

1761
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:55,280
and this is where you can set your fees

1762
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:56,319
now the fees here there's a base fee

1763
01:00:55,280 --> 01:01:00,079
which means if

1764
01:00:56,319 --> 01:01:02,400
any if any transaction is routed

1765
01:01:00,079 --> 01:01:04,400
through this channel of yours there will

1766
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:06,240
be a minimum charge of one sat

1767
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:08,160
that's basically as low as you can go

1768
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:11,520
great wonderful um

1769
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:14,319
now you also set a fee rate when you

1770
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:14,640
initially start off this will be set to

1771
01:01:14,319 --> 01:01:18,480
one

1772
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:20,319
effectively zero percent um however

1773
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:21,839
if you notice that certain channels

1774
01:01:20,319 --> 01:01:23,440
drain quicker

1775
01:01:21,839 --> 01:01:24,880
that a lot of people are trying to route

1776
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:27,359
through you you can

1777
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:28,240
easily bump up the fees on those

1778
01:01:27,359 --> 01:01:29,520
channels

1779
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:31,359
you may not want to do that right off

1780
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:32,319
the bat as you're establishing yourself

1781
01:01:31,359 --> 01:01:34,240
but as you find

1782
01:01:32,319 --> 01:01:35,680
more transactions are being routed

1783
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:38,480
through you can bump this up

1784
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:39,880
a good starting place might be 250 which

1785
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:42,160
is

1786
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:44,960
0.025 percent

1787
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:46,799
so still very very low some people have

1788
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:49,520
it up around 300

1789
01:01:46,799 --> 01:01:50,640
for this one because i know it is a

1790
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:52,319
merchant and

1791
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:56,400
more people wrote transactions through

1792
01:01:52,319 --> 01:01:58,799
them i'm okay with 500

1793
01:01:56,400 --> 01:02:00,319
so it's kind of up to you if you start

1794
01:01:58,799 --> 01:02:01,839
setting it too high and you notice

1795
01:02:00,319 --> 01:02:03,680
transactions are no longer going through

1796
01:02:01,839 --> 01:02:04,559
it you can lower but this can constantly

1797
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:07,760
be changed

1798
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:10,319
whenever you like okay um

1799
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:11,359
one that i've noticed that i've routed

1800
01:02:10,319 --> 01:02:14,000
quite a few through

1801
01:02:11,359 --> 01:02:15,280
is wallet of satoshi um i have that one

1802
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:17,280
up quite high

1803
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:18,559
i put it at a thousand i don't know that

1804
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:20,160
any have been routed through there but

1805
01:02:18,559 --> 01:02:20,480
i'm just kind of testing the waters and

1806
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:23,440
this

1807
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:24,960
is this is kind of what you can do with

1808
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:26,400
lightning you can tinker and see what

1809
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:28,400
works and what doesn't it was previously

1810
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:31,119
at 500 there was still a lot of

1811
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:32,880
transactions going through but hey uh

1812
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:35,839
feel free to play around with this

1813
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:36,240
don't worry too much about your fees you

1814
01:02:35,839 --> 01:02:39,920
can

1815
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:39,920
tinker and see what works for you

1816
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:47,039
now you may find that certain channels

1817
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:47,760
always tend to drain in a certain

1818
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:50,880
direction

1819
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:52,240
either remote or a local where you can

1820
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:54,160
send a lot out

1821
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:55,839
but you can't receive a lot constantly

1822
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:57,200
or where you can receive a lot but you

1823
01:02:55,839 --> 01:02:59,200
can't send a lot

1824
01:02:57,200 --> 01:03:02,079
just based on the direction of

1825
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:02,880
transactions that you are routing what

1826
01:03:02,079 --> 01:03:04,640
you can do

1827
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:06,400
if you find this happens a lot espec

1828
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:07,280
especially with particular channels is

1829
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:09,680
you can use the

1830
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:11,039
rebalance function here in thunderhub so

1831
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:12,720
just along the side

1832
01:03:11,039 --> 01:03:14,960
there's a rebalance tab that you can

1833
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:16,480
click on and here

1834
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:18,240
you're brought to a screen where you

1835
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:20,079
select the outgoing channel and the

1836
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:22,799
incoming channel and effectively you're

1837
01:03:20,079 --> 01:03:23,680
bumping some sats from one channel over

1838
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:25,839
to the next

1839
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:27,520
to make things balance out a little bit

1840
01:03:25,839 --> 01:03:29,440
so on the outgoing side

1841
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:30,880
i know that i've got a channel with bit

1842
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:32,880
refill which is

1843
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:34,400
relatively well connected that is

1844
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:36,799
entirely local

1845
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:39,200
okay so i can send but i basically can't

1846
01:03:36,799 --> 01:03:42,240
receive much of anything through there

1847
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:44,079
now on the incoming side

1848
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:45,359
there are a number of different nodes

1849
01:03:44,079 --> 01:03:49,039
that i have uh

1850
01:03:45,359 --> 01:03:52,079
you know mostly incoming and no outgoing

1851
01:03:49,039 --> 01:03:55,200
okay so here's one where

1852
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:55,760
uh i've got only 10 of capacity is on my

1853
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:58,319
side

1854
01:03:55,760 --> 01:04:00,480
and the rest is on the other side so

1855
01:03:58,319 --> 01:04:03,920
maybe i would like to route

1856
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:05,440
some sats through bit refill and have it

1857
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:07,119
come out on the other side of this

1858
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:08,160
channel so that things are a bit more

1859
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:10,640
balanced

1860
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:12,400
so i've chosen my two routes that i'd

1861
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:14,880
like to go through

1862
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:16,720
and at this point we need to set the

1863
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:18,960
fees that we would be okay with

1864
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:19,920
paying in the process of rebalancing

1865
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:21,440
these channels

1866
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:24,160
and these are kind of like a maximum

1867
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:27,599
that you're willing to pay now for this

1868
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:29,680
i don't mind paying i don't know

1869
01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:31,039
let's say let's call it 2000 sats and

1870
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:34,000
it's not gonna get up that

1871
01:04:31,039 --> 01:04:35,520
i'm i'm setting it that high so it's

1872
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:37,760
more likely that it'll work for this

1873
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:40,160
tutorial but you can keep it quite low

1874
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:41,200
and then just poke and prod and see what

1875
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:44,400
turns out for you

1876
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:46,240
um they started at at 10 sats just to

1877
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:47,920
to give you an idea but i'm just hedging

1878
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:50,640
my bets and then at max

1879
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:52,319
fee rate the highest i had set on any of

1880
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:54,160
my channels was a thousand i don't even

1881
01:04:52,319 --> 01:04:57,039
know if anything's going through them so

1882
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:58,079
i'll just set that as my my lower end a

1883
01:04:57,039 --> 01:04:59,599
lot of people are going to look at that

1884
01:04:58,079 --> 01:05:02,480
and say that's crazy that's way too high

1885
01:04:59,599 --> 01:05:03,520
again just i'm just hedging my bets

1886
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:04,960
because i don't want to tinker too much

1887
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:07,280
while i'm doing this

1888
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:09,200
next you're going to choose the amount

1889
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:12,319
that you would like to route through

1890
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:13,839
to to bump um between the channels

1891
01:05:12,319 --> 01:05:15,760
you can do a fixed amount where you're

1892
01:05:13,839 --> 01:05:17,440
like i need this amount to go through or

1893
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:18,000
you can do a target amount where you're

1894
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:20,079
like

1895
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:22,559
if it comes up a little bit short no big

1896
01:05:20,079 --> 01:05:26,880
deal i'm going to do target

1897
01:05:22,559 --> 01:05:28,799
and i'm going to do 600 000 sats just to

1898
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:30,559
kind of see how that goes

1899
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:31,760
if you want you can avoid certain nodes

1900
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:33,440
if you know there's ones that have

1901
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:34,160
stupidly high fees you can put that in

1902
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:35,520
there

1903
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:37,520
everything looks good to me so i'm going

1904
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:40,000
to hit the rebalance button see how it

1905
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:40,000
pans out

1906
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:43,760
now of course this is dependent on it

1907
01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:44,400
finding a route between these two

1908
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:46,240
channels

1909
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:47,760
who knows if that will happen and it has

1910
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:52,319
to be within the confines

1911
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:55,920
of the fees that i set we shall see

1912
01:05:52,319 --> 01:05:55,920
a few moments later

1913
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:01,920
so it didn't go through not a big deal

1914
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:04,160
again i

1915
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:05,680
just wanted to show you the example it

1916
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:08,480
could have been that there were

1917
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:11,520
uh there wasn't the liquidity in some of

1918
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:13,119
the channels along the way that it found

1919
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:14,720
not a big deal this is just something

1920
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:17,280
that you can tinker with if you choose

1921
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:19,520
to i have successfully rebalanced

1922
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:21,520
in the past so just know that that's not

1923
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:24,640
necessarily representative of it

1924
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:27,440
but um as i suspect

1925
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:28,559
with a lot of lightning stuff it will

1926
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:30,240
continue to become

1927
01:06:28,559 --> 01:06:33,039
easier and easier to do this into the

1928
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:35,359
future but at least you know the basics

1929
01:06:33,039 --> 01:06:35,359
now

1930
01:06:38,559 --> 01:06:41,760
we can dig into some of the data that we

1931
01:06:40,319 --> 01:06:43,680
do get through our node here there's a

1932
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:46,079
few things that i found interesting

1933
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:47,440
one of them is if you go to the forwards

1934
01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:50,400
tab and click

1935
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:51,440
you can see the channels that are most

1936
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:55,119
frequently

1937
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:57,680
used in routing payments i can see that

1938
01:06:55,119 --> 01:06:59,280
going in through the stacking stats

1939
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:01,359
through the tftc node

1940
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:04,640
and out through wallet of satoshi it's

1941
01:07:01,359 --> 01:07:07,520
routed eight payments that way

1942
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:09,039
in fact routing channels or routing

1943
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:10,000
payments out through the wallet of

1944
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:13,440
satoshi one

1945
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:14,319
have been quite frequent and stacking

1946
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:16,640
sats seems to

1947
01:07:14,319 --> 01:07:18,400
have a lot of ones coming in through it

1948
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:20,559
at least 12 of them that i can see here

1949
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:24,079
you can see a count along the side

1950
01:07:20,559 --> 01:07:25,839
um now you can also see up here you can

1951
01:07:24,079 --> 01:07:28,160
see a count based on

1952
01:07:25,839 --> 01:07:30,079
uh whatever time frame you're looking at

1953
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:32,000
so this is kind of zoomed in but

1954
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:33,680
based on the week how many payments you

1955
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:36,400
wrote it i did 34 on

1956
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:38,160
one day there five ten seven so it

1957
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:40,640
depends how well connected you are

1958
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:42,319
you can see how many sats were sent

1959
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:44,720
total on a particular day

1960
01:07:42,319 --> 01:07:46,960
and then you can also click on fees and

1961
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:48,880
see the fees in total

1962
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:51,039
that you have collected and how much

1963
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:53,760
i've gone through on certain days so

1964
01:07:51,039 --> 01:07:55,039
460 that day one day it was 2 000 sats

1965
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:57,440
that came through

1966
01:07:55,039 --> 01:07:58,319
it just really depends on what your fees

1967
01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:00,720
are set but

1968
01:07:58,319 --> 01:08:02,319
interesting to look at nonetheless you

1969
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:05,520
can also see

1970
01:08:02,319 --> 01:08:07,920
grouped by channel incoming and outgoing

1971
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:09,839
you can see which ones are heavy on one

1972
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:11,119
side or the other

1973
01:08:09,839 --> 01:08:14,240
and which ones are a little bit more

1974
01:08:11,119 --> 01:08:16,000
balanced or probably the smaller ones

1975
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:17,440
but yeah a lot of good stuff to look at

1976
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:19,359
through there now

1977
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:20,480
another interesting thing that i found

1978
01:08:19,359 --> 01:08:23,839
here is under

1979
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:25,440
stats on the left hand side and here you

1980
01:08:23,839 --> 01:08:26,880
can see info about your note i'll just

1981
01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:28,640
give it a quick little refresh to make

1982
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:31,359
sure it's up to date

1983
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:32,400
so it gives you kind of a score on your

1984
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:35,199
node statistics

1985
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:36,719
flow means how many channels are

1986
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:38,000
actually having activity through them

1987
01:08:36,719 --> 01:08:40,480
you can scroll through and see how

1988
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:41,679
they rank of course a lot of people have

1989
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:44,400
opened

1990
01:08:41,679 --> 01:08:46,080
channels with me that maybe haven't done

1991
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:46,880
any volume yet it's a relatively new

1992
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:49,920
node so

1993
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:53,679
maybe this will improve over time

1994
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:55,759
you can also see uh uptime stats of

1995
01:08:53,679 --> 01:08:57,359
various nodes that are connected to you

1996
01:08:55,759 --> 01:08:59,679
most of mine are pretty good

1997
01:08:57,359 --> 01:09:01,279
but you know if i'm looking at some and

1998
01:08:59,679 --> 01:09:03,679
they look a little suspect

1999
01:09:01,279 --> 01:09:05,279
and they're getting down low maybe it's

2000
01:09:03,679 --> 01:09:06,080
time to think about closing out channels

2001
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:08,319
but

2002
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:09,679
again the note is too new to to really

2003
01:09:08,319 --> 01:09:11,759
worry about that too much

2004
01:09:09,679 --> 01:09:13,279
you can see fee stats from other

2005
01:09:11,759 --> 01:09:15,679
individuals what their

2006
01:09:13,279 --> 01:09:18,000
nodes are set to and then you can also

2007
01:09:15,679 --> 01:09:21,040
see your own fee stats

2008
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:22,960
as to what it ranks as a pretty good fee

2009
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:24,960
so even the ones that i have a little

2010
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:26,000
bit higher like that are set at around

2011
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:29,120
250

2012
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:32,080
it says very good base fees and parts

2013
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:34,000
per million fees or the the 250.

2014
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:36,319
when you start getting above 250 i can

2015
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:37,679
see like async it it gives it a little

2016
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:39,920
less of a good rating

2017
01:09:37,679 --> 01:09:41,199
but i still have uh transactions being

2018
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:42,239
routed through there so i'm not worried

2019
01:09:41,199 --> 01:09:44,239
about that but

2020
01:09:42,239 --> 01:09:45,600
um some interesting info that you can

2021
01:09:44,239 --> 01:09:49,040
glean from that

2022
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:49,279
and very very useful and the last thing

2023
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:52,080
i

2024
01:09:49,279 --> 01:09:52,960
really want to touch on here is i really

2025
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:56,000
want to touch on

2026
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:59,120
backing up your channel states

2027
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:00,320
okay so yes when you set up your umbral

2028
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:03,920
node you have

2029
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:06,080
a uh you you do have a seed phrase

2030
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:07,280
that you back up and you store safely

2031
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:10,000
and that

2032
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:10,880
does pertain to all of your bitcoin on

2033
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:13,920
that node

2034
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:15,679
however you'd also want to back up your

2035
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:17,040
channel states for your lightning node

2036
01:10:15,679 --> 01:10:20,560
and the way you do that

2037
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:22,880
is in the tools tab you hit on tools

2038
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:23,600
and then you can see an option that says

2039
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:26,480
backup

2040
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:28,840
all channels and you just hit download

2041
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:32,480
and you want to do this

2042
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:34,320
basically relatively frequently honestly

2043
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:34,880
when i'm on my note every time i'm on

2044
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:37,760
here

2045
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:39,600
um once a day once every couple of days

2046
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:40,320
at the very least i would say once a

2047
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:42,640
week

2048
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:43,520
give this a download and just have it as

2049
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:45,760
a file

2050
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:47,440
where you can readily use it and even

2051
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:49,679
back it up

2052
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:50,719
elsewhere you know pull it on to an sd

2053
01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:52,239
or even

2054
01:10:50,719 --> 01:10:53,920
encrypted cloud storage whatever you

2055
01:10:52,239 --> 01:10:56,159
want but just have a copy of that

2056
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:58,000
in case something happens to your node

2057
01:10:56,159 --> 01:10:59,600
you will be able to re-access all of

2058
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,960
these channels and nobody can kind of

2059
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:04,640
run away with money

2060
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:06,400
or say that they hadn't paid you

2061
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:08,000
and try to close the channel so and so

2062
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:08,480
forth people can kind of mess around

2063
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:12,960
with that

2064
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:14,480
if you don't have the channel states um

2065
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:16,159
and then finally if you do want to

2066
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:17,360
recover this is where you would do it

2067
01:11:16,159 --> 01:11:19,199
you'd come back here

2068
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:21,280
and you'd hit the recover button and use

2069
01:11:19,199 --> 01:11:23,120
that same file that you just downloaded

2070
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:25,120
and you will recover all of your channel

2071
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:28,320
states that

2072
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:28,320
is pretty much that

2073
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:33,920
this is so much you guys i apologize

2074
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:36,880
this was a lengthy one

2075
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:38,800
uh but hopefully you find this useful

2076
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:39,600
obviously i'm gonna miss things i may

2077
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:41,760
misspeak

2078
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:43,840
this is also new to me don't take me as

2079
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:44,719

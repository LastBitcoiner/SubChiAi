what's up guys my name is cody and in

today's video i will be showing you some

amazing solo plays to improve your

mirage games

these tips will guarantee kills and

maximize your chances of winning games

on mirage

that being said let's get into it

this play will guarantee a quick kill on

a ramp on ct side mirage

in order to perfect this play to the

best of its ability the utility lineups

will be necessary

as soon as you are able to you should

throw a molotov towards ramp

blocking off the early push this will

keep all players with a good ramp spawn

unable to catch you off guard next you

throw a flash against the furthest wall

which will act as a pop flash to the

players towards the ramp

then after the flash explodes peak

towards ramp behind the molotov

due to the molotov's flames the visions

of players will be obscured

this accompanied with a quick flashbang

will ensure to blind the player towards

ramp and within the first 10 seconds of

a round

you will already have a player advantage

for your team

quick easy and smooth brother you can't

ask for more than that

what is up pro grads family i hope

you're all winning your facebook games

and grinding those pugs

i just wanted to stop by and mention

that we're having a 15 off sale on our

website proguides.com with the special

code

pg special make sure to use it at

checkout when you purchase anything on

our website

have fun grinding and i will see you all

soon when

retaking b site from ct side it is very

difficult to retake from market

and takes too long to go towards short

therefore in a 1v1 or 1v2 situation

it is best to show presence towards

market usually by throwing a piece of

utility towards market window from the

murder hole position

entrance to jungle from ct this next

play will take a lot of practice to

execute a hundred percent of the time

but will always catch the player off

guard due to the distracting smoke flash

molotov grenade that has just been

thrown from the market

you will then jump from window under

short edge this maneuver makes very

little sound at all

and therefore won't be heard from a

t-side player guarding the bomb

after it has been planted now all that

is necessary to slowly push towards the

b

bomb site the benefit of this play is

the fact that many players on t

side will be playing towards back of

their sight after the information that

you are at the market

they will be a standstill target holding

an angle that you are no longer anywhere

near what you looking at bro

i'm not even there dude therefore they

will be in the open

and a simple kill and then just a bomb

defuse is needed to win the round

easy peasy lemon squeezy oh

sometimes games will be very difficult

and it will be the half by

slash eco rounds that will change the

favor of the game

may the odds be ever in your favor wait

a minute this is not hunger games oh

yeah counter strike

okay this little trick can gain a major

control of the map

which is middle and has a cost of only

eighteen fifty dollars

this tip can be very effective when your

team doesn't have money but you do

money money money money

who's got the gwop you got to go up time

to spend

this trick involves smoking top of

middle from t spawn

after doing so you throw a pop flash

towards the smoke this flash will land

deep enough towards middle

and the window player will be blind this

is the same with the connector player

and the short player then after throwing

this flash you can either push

towards connector going for an early

kill picking up the weapon and being

able to change the round for your team

you can also push towards middle trying

to kill the window player or the short

player

but the best place to push is connector

as most window players won't be looking

towards top mid

therefore will not be able to help the

connector player furthermore the lower

connector area is very protected and can

only be seen from top connector

and pushed up short players but due to

the flash they will have to back

off therefore you are in a safe position

to push into connector early

getting a quick kill plus a rifle that

you can use to help clean up the other

ct

players therefore winning a difficult

round and completely

changed the economy in the game wow

things are a lot different now

yes sir that's because you made an

impact

if you prefer the aggressive style of

play and dislike

sitting back and holding an angle on ct

side then

perfect because this next trick is just

for you this trick

is fairly reliant on spawns but lucky

for you

this is a route that is great for both a

sight and b

sight sometimes a lot of players will be

caught out

heavily by an early push towards a or b

sight

if you have a good a-spawn the best

thing for you to do is an early rush

into palace

this strategy works best when having a

close range weapon such as an smg

as it has a fast rate of fire at close

range makes it nearly impossible to kill

and also better on the move if you push

into palace off spawn

by making the jumps on the default box

the meeting point in palace is towards

the first pillar in palace

therefore as a ct you will be getting

there before the palace player

and completely catching them off guard

usually with a knife in hand

trying to get a haircut dude oh look at

that i hit your jugular instead

my bad on the flip side on

b if you have a good spawn push into

underpass

early it'll grant you with a quick kill

with little chance of death

due to the fact that the meeting point

to underpass is just towards the archway

therefore meaning either the t-side

player will be running down the stairs

firing at a lower angle and therefore

their crosshair placement will change

while they're moving forward

where if you're pushing from under it's

a flat floor therefore

crosshair placement is constant and in

turn one can pre-aim the angle that

their t-side player would be found in

when pushing into under early the

t-sided player will be in the center of

the stairs

and therefore would have no cover

whereas a ct

player you would be able to use the

close wall as cover to jiggle peak the

player pushing

or something to fall off to after

getting a kill both

underpass and palace for the t side is

usually a position being pushed or held

by one player

so after getting the kill the likelihood

of you dying by a second player

trying to trade is very low therefore

showing another quick tip on how you can

maximize your kills and round win

percentage by getting a fast kill

like speedy gonzales out there dude wow

that was fast

another trick will be for the operas of

the cs go community

on ct's side most t-side players will

throw utility

towards window making it either

impossible to have a line of sight

with smoke or being able to stay in the

location with flash grenade molotov

therefore making it quite difficult to

get important kills towards mid

it's much better to actually peek from

connector behind a smoke

as you are very difficult to flash off

the angle most players will not usually

pre-aim or pre-fire your position

they ain't thinking ahead dude they

ain't smart they ain't seen pro

guides have you guys gone to

proguides.com by the way it's a great

website and it'll help you out with all

these

tips and tricks okay you can get pro

coaching over there guys just check it

out

anywho utility is very difficult to be

used to get the player off the angle

and by using a smoke inside connector it

is very difficult to even be

seen by players towards top mid this is

such an important position

as it allows you to get one or two quick

early kills to suppress the mid push

and after getting information of where

the enemy team is pushing

it's very simple to turn those one to

two kill rounds with the op

into four five kill rounds if the enemy

team wants to push up short they would

need to smoke off the topcon angle

and if so you can rotate into window

room and you will have enough time to

kill players pushing into short if they

don't

smoke you off then easy kills similar to

a sight when the enemy team is pushing

towards a

if they smoke you off both jungle and

stairs it's not a problem at all

the smoke will last only about to 18

seconds

by this time usually the enemy team will

have to clear every angle

plus the 4 second bomb plane so the

smoke will usually have faded by the

time that the enemy team have just

planted the bomb

therefore in any plant position it is

very difficult

to win the stairs gunfight with info the

fact that having a headshot

angle and the op means that anyone

peeking into your line of sight

yeah they're going to be losing the

fight boom headshot

this final trick will be for the fast

push onto the a

sight from palace in order to complete

this to the best of its ability

you will need to have a smoke molotov

and a flash

with the assistance of armor and a rifle

smg you will throw a smoke on top of

balcony therefore you cannot die when

pushing out onto balcony

you will moultov under balcony from

palace using a lineup with one of the

pillars

and the corner of the palace wall this

will land through the ladder hole

will bloom under balcony and force

players out onto sight

towards default area finally throw a

pop-up flash towards the door out of

palace

this flash will blind all players

looking towards palace the smoke will

provide enough cover to use the util

and the molotov will force players into

the angle you are blinding

then just push out of the smoke palace

and jump towards defaults

the flash will blind the enemy sat

towards default or triple box if looked

at

and if they aren't looking at the palace

angle it will let you push into default

and have a lot of control of the a

sight just from one simple play oh this

one is gold guys for real

try it out this next play is one that

will always annoy the enemy team as it's

very difficult to counter and puts you

in a

very precarious position firstly you

will slowly push towards

under making no sound so the enemy team

has no idea where you are

you are in the under position you will

throw a smoke towards short and a

molotov in the jungle window this will

force players into your line of sight or

away from jungle completely then you

will stand

on the bench in middle and jump towards

the box under window

then you throw a flash towards connector

wait

wait wait approximately two to three

seconds and then

shift into window you will either be met

with a distracted player who becomes a

free

kill or nothing after successfully

getting into window

the choice is yours either slowly push

towards b

site from market and get all the kills

on b or go

towards jungle and take out the a

players the benefit of this play

is it gets you deep in the enemy lines

and you can choose where to go

and create havoc

[Laughter]

yes the next play is to get some quick

kills from a very safe position

firstly you push towards ramp's side

next you need to throw a smoke in

between tetris and the palace boxes

next you will throw a molotov towards

under balcony therefore

forcing enemy players into your line of

sight if they're hiding there

smoke them out brother this will usually

result in players towards a site looking

at tetris

as most players would usually cross to

tetris to hide

run and hide i will still find you but

instead you will shift towards the left

side of the smoke and you will have an

amazing gap

in the smoke big enough to get kills on

the a site

but you will be very difficult to be

seen ooh tricky tricky

after getting one or two kills you can

easily fall off back to ramp

or push into the sight push it to the

limit push it

push it real good now i know it's whip

it but push it works for this song all

right cut

right if you find it difficult to hold

off the b

site on your own there are a couple

spots where you can hardly be seen

and you will be able to get some free

kills on the players pushing out of

apartments

the first position will be on the right

side of van just in front of the boxes

remember to stay crouched in this spot

as it means the t-side players will be

completely in the open

and will have nowhere to fall off too so

it will be an easy gunfight to win

you have nowhere to run dude you

are done for you also have clear vision

of players

jumping out of window so they will be

another free kill as they won't be

checking your angle yeah i'm over here

dude

what's up brah you thought i was over

there dude no no no i'm over here dude

boom boom boom to the face another

amazing angle to play is on top of the

boxes towards the market side

make sure you throw smoke in the jump

out window

therefore players and apartments are

forced to play slowly

slowly like molasses can we get some

more molasses ma

i think we're out of molasses no son we

got molasses the other day

what are you talking about mom i don't

see any more molasses it's not in the

fridge

well that's because we don't have

fridges it's like the 1700s dummy

oh yeah that's right all right well

never mind man

next you will shift yourself on top of

the boxes on the back side

therefore getting a very tight but

unstoppable angle on the b

site if t-side players are pushing fast

you can just wait until they get to the

balcony to kill them but because of the

smoke

they are forced to play slow and will be

an easy kill to get

for our final trick this will be the one

that you can only use

once or twice a game but it will

guarantee to counter a fast a push

sometimes certain teams can just fast

push onto a site

and it's very difficult to counter and

also beat that fast a aggression

this tip will ensure you will win the

round with possibly getting three or

four kills in the process

that sounds pretty good to me this play

is done best with an

op or aug as it has good accuracy at

range

firstly you will crouch jump onto the

brown box underneath ticket

then you need to right click a smoke

into the ticket window

make sure not to throw it so hard that

it breaks the window and falls to the

bottom

but if thrown correctly it'll break the

window and will land inside on a small

ledge now all you need to do is jump on

top of the ticket box

and play around the smoke sometimes

crouching may be necessary to ensure

surprise of this position

crouching tiger hidden dragon ah

take my flames ah take my fiery flames

you wiggling

this play is best when a team is

constantly throwing smoke towards ct

as they will just assume the ct smoke

messed up once they push out

all you need to do is get those easy

kills

boom i'll take you boom i'll also take

you

boom i'll take you as well thanks a lot

come again

once a player has taken their eyes off

the game it is yours for the taking and

by using these quick and easy tips you

will see a rapid change

in your play style on mirage and other

maps

after learning and perfecting all these

solo plays you will become

everyone's kryptonite when it comes to

this map

we wish you luck in your next games and

i'll see y'all

in the next video

       "\"[Music] what's up guys my name is cody and in today's video i will be showing you some amazing solo plays to improve your mirage games these tips will guarantee kills and maximize your chances of winning games on mirage that being said let's get into it this play will guarantee a quick kill on a ramp on ct side mirage in order to perfect this play to the best of its ability the utility lineups will be necessary as soon as you are able to you should throw a molotov towards ramp blocking off the early push this will keep all players with a good ramp spawn unable to catch you off guard next you throw a flash against the furthest wall which will act as a pop flash to the players towards the ramp then after the flash explodes peak towards ramp behind the molotov due to the molotov's flames the visions of players will be obscured this accompanied with a quick flashbang will ensure to blind the player towards ramp and within the first 10 seconds of a round you will already have a player advantage for your team quick easy and smooth brother you can't ask for more than that what is up pro grads family i hope you're all winning your facebook games and grinding those pugs i just wanted to stop by and mention that we're having a 15 off sale on our website proguides.com with the special code pg special make sure to use it at checkout when you purchase anything on our website have fun grinding and i will see you all soon when retaking b site from ct side it is very difficult to retake from market and takes too long to go towards short therefore in a 1v1 or 1v2 situation it is best to show presence towards market usually by throwing a piece of utility towards market window from the murder hole position entrance to jungle from ct this next play will take a lot of practice to execute a hundred percent of the time but will always catch the player off guard due to the distracting smoke flash molotov grenade that has just been thrown from the market you will then jump from window under short edge this maneuver makes very little sound at all and therefore won't be heard from a t-side player guarding the bomb after it has been planted now all that is necessary to slowly push towards the b bomb site the benefit of this play is the fact that many players on t side will be playing towards back of their sight after the information that you are at the market they will be a standstill target holding an angle that you are no longer anywhere near what you looking at bro i'm not even there dude therefore they will be in the open and a simple kill and then just a bomb defuse is needed to win the round easy peasy lemon squeezy oh sometimes games will be very difficult and it will be the half by slash eco rounds that will change the favor of the game may the odds be ever in your favor wait a minute this is not hunger games oh yeah counter strike okay this little trick can gain a major control of the map which is middle and has a cost of only eighteen fifty dollars this tip can be very effective when your team doesn't have money but you do money money money money who's got the gwop you got to go up time to spend this trick involves smoking top of middle from t spawn after doing so you throw a pop flash towards the smoke this flash will land deep enough towards middle and the window player will be blind this is the same with the connector player and the short player then after throwing this flash you can either push towards connector going for an early kill picking up the weapon and being able to change the round for your team you can also push towards middle trying to kill the window player or the short player but the best place to push is connector as most window players won't be looking towards top mid therefore will not be able to help the connector player furthermore the lower connector area is very protected and can only be seen from top connector and pushed up short players but due to the flash they will have to back off therefore you are in a safe position to push into connector early getting a quick kill plus a rifle that you can use to help clean up the other ct players therefore winning a difficult round and completely changed the economy in the game wow things are a lot different now yes sir that's because you made an impact if you prefer the aggressive style of play and dislike sitting back and holding an angle on ct side then perfect because this next trick is just for you this trick is fairly reliant on spawns but lucky for you this is a route that is great for both a sight and b sight sometimes a lot of players will be caught out heavily by an early push towards a or b sight if you have a good a-spawn the best thing for you to do is an early rush into palace this strategy works best when having a close range weapon such as an smg as it has a fast rate of fire at close range makes it nearly impossible to kill and also better on the move if you push into palace off spawn by making the jumps on the default box the meeting point in palace is towards the first pillar in palace therefore as a ct you will be getting there before the palace player and completely catching them off guard usually with a knife in hand trying to get a haircut dude oh look at that i hit your jugular instead my bad on the flip side on b if you have a good spawn push into underpass early it'll grant you with a quick kill with little chance of death due to the fact that the meeting point to underpass is just towards the archway therefore meaning either the t-side player will be running down the stairs firing at a lower angle and therefore their crosshair placement will change while they're moving forward where if you're pushing from under it's a flat floor therefore crosshair placement is constant and in turn one can pre-aim the angle that their t-side player would be found in when pushing into under early the t-sided player will be in the center of the stairs and therefore would have no cover whereas a ct player you would be able to use the close wall as cover to jiggle peak the player pushing or something to fall off to after getting a kill both underpass and palace for the t side is usually a position being pushed or held by one player so after getting the kill the likelihood of you dying by a second player trying to trade is very low therefore showing another quick tip on how you can maximize your kills and round win percentage by getting a fast kill like speedy gonzales out there dude wow that was fast another trick will be for the operas of the cs go community on ct's side most t-side players will throw utility towards window making it either impossible to have a line of sight with smoke or being able to stay in the location with flash grenade molotov therefore making it quite difficult to get important kills towards mid it's much better to actually peek from connector behind a smoke as you are very difficult to flash off the angle most players will not usually pre-aim or pre-fire your position they ain't thinking ahead dude they ain't smart they ain't seen pro guides have you guys gone to proguides.com by the way it's a great website and it'll help you out with all these tips and tricks okay you can get pro coaching over there guys just check it out anywho utility is very difficult to be used to get the player off the angle and by using a smoke inside connector it is very difficult to even be seen by players towards top mid this is such an important position as it allows you to get one or two quick early kills to suppress the mid push and after getting information of where the enemy team is pushing it's very simple to turn those one to two kill rounds with the op into four five kill rounds if the enemy team wants to push up short they would need to smoke off the topcon angle and if so you can rotate into window room and you will have enough time to kill players pushing into short if they don't smoke you off then easy kills similar to a sight when the enemy team is pushing towards a if they smoke you off both jungle and stairs it's not a problem at all the smoke will last only about to 18 seconds by this time usually the enemy team will have to clear every angle plus the 4 second bomb plane so the smoke will usually have faded by the time that the enemy team have just planted the bomb therefore in any plant position it is very difficult to win the stairs gunfight with info the fact that having a headshot angle and the op means that anyone peeking into your line of sight yeah they're going to be losing the fight boom headshot this final trick will be for the fast push onto the a sight from palace in order to complete this to the best of its ability you will need to have a smoke molotov and a flash with the assistance of armor and a rifle smg you will throw a smoke on top of balcony therefore you cannot die when pushing out onto balcony you will moultov under balcony from palace using a lineup with one of the pillars and the corner of the palace wall this will land through the ladder hole will bloom under balcony and force players out onto sight towards default area finally throw a pop-up flash towards the door out of palace this flash will blind all players looking towards palace the smoke will provide enough cover to use the util and the molotov will force players into the angle you are blinding then just push out of the smoke palace and jump towards defaults the flash will blind the enemy sat towards default or triple box if looked at and if they aren't looking at the palace angle it will let you push into default and have a lot of control of the a sight just from one simple play oh this one is gold guys for real try it out this next play is one that will always annoy the enemy team as it's very difficult to counter and puts you in a very precarious position firstly you will slowly push towards under making no sound so the enemy team has no idea where you are you are in the under position you will throw a smoke towards short and a molotov in the jungle window this will force players into your line of sight or away from jungle completely then you will stand on the bench in middle and jump towards the box under window then you throw a flash towards connector wait wait wait approximately two to three seconds and then shift into window you will either be met with a distracted player who becomes a free kill or nothing after successfully getting into window the choice is yours either slowly push towards b site from market and get all the kills on b or go towards jungle and take out the a players the benefit of this play is it gets you deep in the enemy lines and you can choose where to go and create havoc [Laughter] yes the next play is to get some quick kills from a very safe position firstly you push towards ramp's side next you need to throw a smoke in between tetris and the palace boxes next you will throw a molotov towards under balcony therefore forcing enemy players into your line of sight if they're hiding there smoke them out brother this will usually result in players towards a site looking at tetris as most players would usually cross to tetris to hide run and hide i will still find you but instead you will shift towards the left side of the smoke and you will have an amazing gap in the smoke big enough to get kills on the a site but you will be very difficult to be seen ooh tricky tricky after getting one or two kills you can easily fall off back to ramp or push into the sight push it to the limit push it push it real good now i know it's whip it but push it works for this song all right cut right if you find it difficult to hold off the b site on your own there are a couple spots where you can hardly be seen and you will be able to get some free kills on the players pushing out of apartments the first position will be on the right side of van just in front of the boxes remember to stay crouched in this spot as it means the t-side players will be completely in the open and will have nowhere to fall off too so it will be an easy gunfight to win you have nowhere to run dude you are done for you also have clear vision of players jumping out of window so they will be another free kill as they won't be checking your angle yeah i'm over here dude what's up brah you thought i was over there dude no no no i'm over here dude boom boom boom to the face another amazing angle to play is on top of the boxes towards the market side make sure you throw smoke in the jump out window therefore players and apartments are forced to play slowly slowly like molasses can we get some more molasses ma i think we're out of molasses no son we got molasses the other day what are you talking about mom i don't see any more molasses it's not in the fridge well that's because we don't have fridges it's like the 1700s dummy oh yeah that's right all right well never mind man next you will shift yourself on top of the boxes on the back side therefore getting a very tight but unstoppable angle on the b site if t-side players are pushing fast you can just wait until they get to the balcony to kill them but because of the smoke they are forced to play slow and will be an easy kill to get for our final trick this will be the one that you can only use once or twice a game but it will guarantee to counter a fast a push sometimes certain teams can just fast push onto a site and it's very difficult to counter and also beat that fast a aggression this tip will ensure you will win the round with possibly getting three or four kills in the process that sounds pretty good to me this play is done best with an op or aug as it has good accuracy at range firstly you will crouch jump onto the brown box underneath ticket then you need to right click a smoke into the ticket window make sure not to throw it so hard that it breaks the window and falls to the bottom but if thrown correctly it'll break the window and will land inside on a small ledge now all you need to do is jump on top of the ticket box and play around the smoke sometimes crouching may be necessary to ensure surprise of this position crouching tiger hidden dragon ah take my flames ah take my fiery flames you wiggling this play is best when a team is constantly throwing smoke towards ct as they will just assume the ct smoke messed up once they push out all you need to do is get those easy kills boom i'll take you boom i'll also take you boom i'll take you as well thanks a lot come again once a player has taken their eyes off the game it is yours for the taking and by using these quick and easy tips you will see a rapid change in your play style on mirage and other maps after learning and perfecting all these solo plays you will become everyone's kryptonite when it comes to this map we wish you luck in your next games and i'll see y'all in the next video [Applause] \""
